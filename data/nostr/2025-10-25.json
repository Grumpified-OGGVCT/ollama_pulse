      "summary": "Bitcoin Magazine Save Our Wallets: Bitcoiners Must Act To Defend Their Right To Transact Recent threats against the rights of bitcoiners to transact in the manner they deem fit led to the creation of Save Our Wallets. Done in collaboration with the Bitcoin Policy Institute, CoinCenter, the Bitcoin Design Foundation, and many regional Bitcoin hubs around the United States, the organization recently launched the “Satoshi Needs You!” campaign. Satoshi needs all of you to rally together to ensure that the Blockchain Regulatory Certainty Act (BRCA) provisions are included in the coming version of the CLARITY Act, to ensure that self-custodial software tools in the Bitcoin ecosystem remain a protected thing, unencumbered by financial regulations designed to restrict businesses actually taking control of users’ funds. The trials this summer prosecuted by the Department of Justice (DOJ) against the developers of Samourai Wallet and Tornado Cash have set dangerous precedents by prosecuting developers of open-source and self-custodial software, which at no time gave developers control over user funds in any way, and flies directly against standing guidance from both the DOJ as well as FinCEN, the regulator in charge of the application of the relevant regulations from both cases. The “Satoshi Needs You!” campaign aims to raise awareness of the current threats to bitcoiners’ rights and rally people to get involved in the push to cement these rights in explicit regulation. “This is a moment of both great danger and great opportunity for the bitcoin network” said Kyle Olney, co-founder of SaveOurWallets.org. “We can’t take anything for granted until our fundamental rights to economic liberty in the digital realm have been codified into law. We need EVERY bitcoiner to get involved, contact their representatives in Washington DC, and ensure this congress continues to execute on pro-Bitcoin policy. We have a responsibility to fight for our freedoms like the right to transact, and to pass those rights on for future generations.” Visit SaveOurWallets.org to learn more about the CLARITY Act and how you can get involved in the fight to include the BRCA provisions.

The exchange follows Schiff’s announcement that he’s launching his own blockchain-based gold product — and CZ’s sharp critique that such tokens are “not truly on-chain.” “As much as you voice against Bitcoin, you are always professional and nonpersonal,” CZ told Schiff on X today. “I appreciate that.

The product will reportedly allow users to purchase physical gold through a mobile app, store it in secure vaults, and transfer or redeem it digitally. Schiff describes it as “real money for the digital age” — physical gold represented on-chain. All this comes amid a multiyear gold rally, with prices hitting a record $4,380 per ounce earlier this month before settling near $4,128, at time of writing. Schiff argues that tokenized gold could provide a stable, asset-backed alternative to Bitcoin’s volatility, serving as both a medium of exchange and store of value. CZ pushes back: “It’s a ‘Trust Me Bro’ Token” CZ wasted no time in firing back. On X, he called tokenized gold “a ‘trust-me-bro’ token,” arguing that such assets rely on third-party custodians — precisely the kind of centralized trust structures Bitcoin was designed to eliminate. “Tokenizing gold is NOT ‘on-chain’ gold,” CZ wrote. “It’s tokenizing that you trust some third party will give you gold at some later date — maybe decades later, during a war, after management changes, etc.” His comments echo a common view among crypto purists: that true digital ownership requires self-custody and verifiable scarcity — traits Bitcoin has, but gold tokens do not.

      "summary": "Bitcoin Magazine Crypto Market Structure Bill Gains Bipartisan Momentum as Coinbase’s Armstrong Says “We’re 90% There” Even as Washington remains hobbled by a partial government shutdown, momentum for U.S. crypto market structure legislation is quietly reaching new heights. Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong says the industry is “90%” of the way there, describing unprecedented bipartisan cooperation among senators working to finalize the long-awaited regulatory framework for digital assets. Armstrong, who spent this week meeting with both Senate Democrats and Republicans, said the last few sticking points of the CLARITY Act — including rules for decentralized finance (DeFi) and stablecoin rewards — are close to being resolved. “Both sides are working hard to figure out the final 10%, and we’re getting close,” he said in a social media post. “We’re bullish on getting a bill passed by year-end, and hopeful it’s out of Committee by Thanksgiving.” The Coinbase chief’s optimism comes amid a surge of engagement between lawmakers and crypto executives, marking one of the most serious bipartisan pushes to bring clarity to digital asset regulation since Congress first began debating the issue years ago. JUST IN: Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong says, “There is strong bipartisan support to get this market structure legislation done.” pic.twitter.com/Z8PI1OXDJc — Bitcoin Magazine (@BitcoinMagazine) October 23, 2025 Bipartisan crypto breakthrough in July The legislation at the center of these discussions — the Digital Asset Market Clarity Act (CLARITY Act) — passed the House of Representatives in July with a strong bipartisan majority of 294–137. The bill now sits before the Senate Banking Committee, chaired by Sen. Tim Scott (R-SC), with hopes it could advance to the Senate floor before the end of the year. In a CNBC interview on Wednesday, Armstrong described “very productive” meetings with senators from both parties, calling the level of collaboration a positive sign for the U.S. crypto industry. According to multiple people familiar with the meetings, senior lawmakers including Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-NY), Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand (D-NY), and Sen. Cynthia Lummis (R-WY) attended or participated in discussions with Armstrong and other crypto leaders such as Kraken co-CEO David Ripley, Uniswap Labs founder Hayden Adams, and Chainlink Labs’ Sergey Nazarov. The CLARITY Act seeks to end years of regulatory ambiguity by clearly distinguishing which digital assets qualify as securities under the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and which fall under the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC). Under the bill’s framework, sufficiently decentralized networks would fall under CFTC oversight, while tokens with more centralized control or that function as investment contracts would remain under SEC jurisdiction. The legislation also introduces clearer rules for decentralized finance, secondary trading markets, and custody services — areas where the lack of uniform federal guidance has long frustrated both innovators and investors. DeFi and stablecoin legislation Still, the final 10% of negotiations may prove the toughest. One of the key unresolved questions is how to regulate decentralized finance platforms. Armstrong has urged lawmakers to focus oversight on decentralized intermediaries — such as interfaces or aggregators — rather than attempting to regulate open-source protocols themselves. Another area of tension involves stablecoin rewards, which Armstrong says the banking lobby is working to eliminate. Coinbase and other industry advocates argue that consumers should be able to earn yield on regulated stablecoin holdings, similar to how traditional savings accounts pay interest. These debates underscore the competing visions within Congress: Democrats remain focused on preventing illicit finance and ensuring consumer protection, while Republicans emphasize innovation and competitiveness. Despite the bipartisan goodwill, the timing remains precarious. The ongoing government shutdown has slowed committee work and pushed back the formal markup of the bill. Some lawmakers, including Sen. John Kennedy (R-LA), have expressed skepticism that the committee is ready to move forward, citing unanswered questions about regulatory authority and industry influence. Still, supporters say the momentum is undeniable. Sen. Lummis, who has long championed digital asset legislation, recently told attendees at the SALT Wyoming Blockchain Symposium that she expects the market structure bill to reach the president’s desk “before the end of the year — hopefully before Thanksgiving.” This post Crypto Market Structure Bill Gains Bipartisan Momentum as Coinbase’s Armstrong Says “We’re 90% There” first appeared on Bitcoin Magazine and is written by Micah Zimmerman.",

      "title": "Spark and Ark: A Look At Our Newest Bitcoin Layer Twos",
      "summary": "Bitcoin Magazine Spark and Ark: A Look At Our Newest Bitcoin Layer Twos In my quest to find the best solution for Cake Wallet to offer user-friendly, non-custodial Lightning to our users, I’ve gone deep down the rabbit hole of both Spark and Ark. Both are quite novel approaches to Bitcoin layer two networks, and are designed at their core to be interoperable with the broader Bitcoin network for payments via the Lightning Network. While both can be used “just” for Lightning payments, both networks are positioned to rapidly expand and be used for far more than that over the coming months and years. One thing to keep in mind is that while Spark and Ark on their face seem rather similar, in practice and in implementation they are quite distinct. Why do we need new layer twos? Bitcoin at its core is an incredible tool for freedom, but due to block size constraints, we know that the majority of the world will never be able to make transactions on-chain. Enter Lightning, a solution that allows one on-chain transaction to allow for essentially infinite off-chain transactions, expanding the usefulness of Bitcoin’s base layer and making it possible for more people to transact. While Lightning provided a promising approach to scaling Bitcoin payments, ultimately the realization that its best role is as an interoperability layer and not as a tool for end-users to run themselves has become clear. On-chain requirements, liquidity management, liveness requirements, and other core hurdles make the implementation of user-friendly, self-custodial Lightning next to impossible. This has become apparent as most Lightning wallets and use-cases have opted to use custodial or federated models out of a need to simplify the user experience and the implementation difficulty. The biggest win that Spark and Ark provide to the Bitcoin space out of the gate is providing a much simpler and easier way for the average developer to provide Lightning to their users, while allowing for greatly expanded functionality down the line beyond Lightning payments. Ark, simplified History The concept of Ark was created in May of 2023 by Burak, a Lightning advocate and developer. The driving force behind its creation was the realization that the Lightning network as constructed was not effective as an onboarding tool for the average individual due to inbound liquidity requirements among many other things, and that privacy was often lacking. While Burak invented the protocol itself, two companies – Ark Labs and Second – have stepped in to build the Ark protocol into an end-to-end layer-two network for Bitcoin. While both companies are building around the same open-source Ark protocol, their implementations and objectives are rather dissimilar. As a result, I’ll do my best to distill both below where possible. Terminology Ark: Ark is a protocol for moving Bitcoin transactions off-chain by leveraging multisig and pre-signed transactions between users and the Ark Operator. Anything you can do on Bitcoin, you can do on Ark but faster and with lower fees. Ark Operator: The entity running the centralized Ark server infrastructure and responsible for providing liquidity for user’s VTXOs before expiry. Lightning Gateway: The entity that provides the ability for Ark users to send or receive Lightning payments using trustless atomic swaps of Ark VTXOs. This function can be provided by the same entity as the Ark Operator, but is often distinct to spread out counter-party risk. Virtual Transaction Outputs: Also called “VTXOs”, these are very similar to on-chain UTXOs in nature, but are virtual as they aren’t represented as unique UTXOs on-chain and live entirely off-chain. Users send and receive VTXOs within Ark. Rounds: In order to gain true finality and/or refresh VTXOs, Ark users will need to join rounds, where they work together with other Ark users and the Ark Operator to get new VTXOs in exchange for a fee. Making transactions Ark functions very similarly to on-chain Bitcoin transactions, and inherits many of the same mannerisms while allowing transactions to be near-instant and trust-minimized between Ark participants. The sender works with the Ark Operator to sign the VTXO over to the recipient, or in the case of Ark Labs to create a new, chained VTXO for the recipient. This allows a user-experience similar in many ways to on-chain payments, but with far lower fees and far faster transaction times. When the user wants to send or receive Lightning payments, they can work with a Lightning Gateway to atomically swap VTXOs for Lightning payments as-needed. At the moment no offline receive for Lightning payments in Ark is possible, but it’s likely this will be solved in a similarly trust-minimized way within Ark as it is in Spark. If the user desires finality (i.e. they’ve received a large payment), they can choose to join a round to finalize the payment and gain the same finality assumptions as on-chain Bitcoin. The frequency of this round process will vary by Ark Operator – with estimates ranging from every 10min to every hour – and requires a relatively lengthy coordinated signing process between all users seeking to join the round with the Ark Operator. The round frequency can even vary based on demand, and is not something that has to be set in stone to a single frequency unlike Bitcoin block times. As Ark inherits Bitcoin scripting and the UTXO model directly from on-chain Bitcoin, Ark will likely be extended to support token protocols like Taproot Assets in the future. Trust tradeoffs Ark targets a very trust-minimized approach to scaling Bitcoin, striking something of a middle-ground in terms of usability and tradeoffs between Lightning and Spark. Note that Ark as a protocol is rapidly developing, and some of these tradeoffs will hopefully be solved through the use of novel off-chain methods or after the implementation of covenants in Bitcoin. Lack of out-of-round finality While Spark lacks provable finality, Ark strikes something of a middle ground. For small payments, users can rely on the Ark Operator and previous senders to not collude for security, allowing for instant transfers with no need for collaborative signing rounds. Note that by default, payments within Ark will be “out-of-round” payments that lack true finality, a tradeoff that allows Ark to deliver a good user experience out of the box. That being said, users who do need or want true finality can have it by joining a round and receiving a new VTXO from the Ark Operator. Receivers are essentially in control of their preferred trust model. VTXO expiration As a result of the liquidity requirements to operate an Ark instance, Ark Operators need a way to reclaim liquidity regularly. To allow this liquidity reclamation, Ark VTXOs will expire regularly (i.e. after 30d, with the VTXO expiry being set by each Ark Operator), requiring their owners to either join a round to refresh the VTXO or risk giving up control of their funds entirely to the Ark Operator. While the Ark Operator has strong incentives to merely issue a new VTXO to the owner of the expired one when they come back online, both the Ark Operator and the user will have the ability to spend funds until a new VTXO is issued to the user. To avoid funds expiring, users will be required to refresh their VTXOs within that window either directly or by offloading refresh to a delegate. Alternatively, atomic swaps of an expiring VTXO for one with a longer lifecycle could be done with an entity like Boltz for a fee, but that is not yet implemented. Complex round user experience If you’ve ever used Coinjoin on Bitcoin, you know how tedious and unreliable collaboratively signing a transaction with other Bitcoiners can be. In Ark, those seeking true finality for their VTXOs will need to be available throughout a round signing process until its completion, something that will depend heavily on other participants properly completing the signing process. While this is quite trivial to accomplish for a wallet running on an always-online server, it’s rather complex to reliably perform on mobile platforms, especially iOS where no background execution (and thus no ability to be online at the right time for signing) can be guaranteed for any app. As a result of this complex user experience, Ark Labs have come up with a system that leverages delegated third parties performing the refresh in a trust-minimized way for users, offloading the liveliness requirement to a third party. While this third party has no ability to steal funds, if they are offline for any reason or refuse to refresh a given VTXO, the user will be forced to join a round themselves before the expiry period. To mitigate this risk, users can designate multiple delegates, shifting the trust assumptions for expiry to a 1-of-N assumption, where if any delegate is honest their VTXO will be refreshed properly. Second also have a similarly designed system that enables trustless, non-interactive rounds for users, allowing any number of parties to sign for a user during a round (i.e. the wallet provider and a third-party delegate) where if any of those parties signs properly, the users VTXO is properly refreshed. Note that while these two solutions can refresh expiring VTXOs, they cannot give users true finality without the user actively participating in the round themselves. Lastly, it’s important to call out that the vast majority of complexity with the round process can be entirely mitigated if a simple covenant is deployed in an upgrade to Bitcoin, something that would unlock a vastly improved user experience for Ark. Privacy tradeoffs At its core, Ark inherits Bitcoin’s poor privacy and doesn’t provide any notable privacy improvements as a protocol. That being said, its ability to offload execution off-chain and expand Bitcoin’s functionality allows existing and novel privacy protocols to be built on top of it in the future, with covenants fully unlocking things like private rounds within Ark. In the short-term, Ark Labs have planned to use WabiSabi-like blinded credentials to improve privacy from the operator when users participate in rounds. Transaction visibility While all transactions within Ark don’t need to be published on-chain, providing some loose ephemerality, all transaction details are visible to the Ark Operator and shouldn’t be considered private in the truest sense. Instead, viewing the ephemeral privacy provided by Ark as analogous to the VPN model (offloading visibility into transactions from the Bitcoin blockchain to a trusted third-party) is a useful mental model. It’s unclear at this time if Ark Labs and Second will keep transaction data private or publish it publicly, but as with a VPN users should not rely entirely on a promise to not log for their privacy.

From UMA (a username system with natively integrated compliance features for their banking partners) to connections with the failed Libra currency, they have an odd track record of building tools that aren’t quite up to par with Bitcoin’s more cypherpunk roots. But, when I put aside their odd track record and focused purely on what Spark the protocol actually is, it presents a rather useful, pragmatic, and powerful tool overall. Spark at its core takes a lot of the useful features of statechains, a novel approach to layer twos on Bitcoin created by Ruben Somsen in 2018. Spark specifically extends statechains with the idea of “leaves”, allowing users to send any amount in a transaction instead of being solely able to transact with whole UTXOs, one of the biggest issues with statechains up to this point. Terminology Spark Entity: the entity running a given Spark instance, i.e. Lightspark, made up of a collection of Spark Operators. As Spark is an open-source protocol, anyone can start their own Spark Entity, but each Spark Entity controls which Spark Operators can join. Spark Operator: each Spark Entity is composed of one or more Spark Operators, each of which are responsible for validating and signing operations of users within the Spark instance, including transfers of funds and tokens, issuance of new tokens, etc. These can be the same entity as the Spark Entity, or (hopefully) distinct in relationship and jurisdiction from the Spark Entity. Currently the two Operators for Spark are Lightspark themselves and Flashnet, but more are slated to be added in the near future. Spark Service Provider: an entity that provides various services to Spark users, including using atomic swaps to trustlessly send and receive Lightning payments on the users behalf. Spark leaves: Spark solves the issues around whole-coin transfer requirements in statechains with the introduction of leaves. These can be thought of similarly to UTXOs within Bitcoin, as they can be freely broken up into any size necessary. Making transactions At its core, Spark functions by allowing users to easily move Bitcoin around the Spark network near-instantly by working in a trust-minimized way with Spark Operators to transfer ownership of individual leaves to another person. There is no need for a blockchain, confirmations, or liveness between sender and receiver, making payments simple and very fast. When a user wants to make a payment on Lightning, they atomically swap a leaf or leaves from their wallet with a Spark Service Provider who then sends the payment trustlessly on their behalf for a fee. To transfer a Spark leaf, the sender co-signs ownership of the leaf over from themselves + Spark Operators to the new owner + Spark Operators. This is done in such a way that if any of the Spark Operators or previous owner honestly deletes their keyshare used in the co-signing operation, the leaf is then solely owned by the recipient and no double-spend is possible. As this operation only requires collaboration between the Spark Operators and sender and not any other Spark users, these signing rounds are very fast and resistant to DoS attacks. Spark also includes a similar 1-of-N trust model to do offline receive for Lightning payments, a key user-experience improvement over standard Lightning wallet usage. This is especially important when using Spark on a mobile wallet, as mobile platforms cannot guarantee background execution or perfect network access 24/7. In addition to regular payments, Spark has extended the idea to include native token support, with the core focus being on stablecoins like USDT and USDC able to be issued and transferred seamlessly within the Spark network. Tokens transfers themselves share a similar trust model to standard transactions on Spark, and retain the ability to unilaterally exit on-chain. Lastly, users in Spark can unilaterally exit on-chain at any time by publishing a pre-signed exit transaction on-chain. While the cost of exiting can vary widely due to variables like leaf depth and on-chain fee rates, likely pricing out smaller amounts, it’s a critical tool to ensure that funds can be retrieved in the event of a malicious or unavailable Spark Entity. Trust tradeoffs Spark makes a very pragmatic set of tradeoffs that compliment the current issues befalling Lightning and Bitcoin usage today. That being said, there are some major differences with Spark compared to on-chain Bitcoin or Lightning usage. I prefer to use the term “trust-minimized” when talking about Spark (and most other layer two networks) as only self-custody of Bitcoin on-chain can truly be viewed as “trustless”. Lack of true finality The core risk to self-sovereignty in Spark is the lack of true finality, where users can never know for sure that their funds cannot be double-spent through collusion between the Spark Operators and a previous spender. Within Spark, finality (knowing that your funds can only be moved with your keys) exists – but is not provable – on the condition that any single Spark Operator deletes their keyshare after signing off on a Spark transaction. On the flip side, if all Spark Operators are malicious and refuse to delete their keyshare and collude with a previous sender of a leaf you own they can double-spend that leaf and effectively steal funds. While in practice I think this 1-of-N trust assumption is reasonable, it obviously falls far short of the regular, on-chain Bitcoin trust assumptions where true finality is a default. It’s also important to note that due to the pseudonymous nature of Spark transactions, the previous sender could be the same entity as the Spark Entity. Potentially centralized token control While transfers of tokens themselves share the 1-of-N trust assumption of regular Spark payments, the tokens themselves can be frozen at any time if the issuer decides to enable this functionality. While this is similar to many centrally controlled stablecoins like USDT (who freeze and confiscate Tether quite often for legal reasons), it’s important to callout and will likely be enabled in many regulated stablecoins like USDC and USDT. 1-of-N offline Lightning receive security While offline Lightning receives are not trust-minimized in the same way standard Lightning payments are, theft of funds would require all Spark Operators to collude to steal a single Lightning payment, something that is disincentivized due to the small size of Lightning payments and the massive reputational risk if caught stealing from users, something that is easy to detect due to the inherent proof of payment in the Lightning network. Privacy tradeoffs Spark itself should not be viewed as a privacy tool, as it inherits core privacy problems from Bitcoin’s base layer and has made some poor design choices initially when it comes to privacy. That being said, Spark’s core technology could be extended to have fantastic privacy with the introduction of blind signing for all transactions, confidential amounts for token transfers, and other privacy technologies that aren’t normally possible within the Bitcoin ecosystem. Transaction visibility While transactions within Spark aren’t published for all time to a blockchain like on-chain transactions, all Spark Operators do get full visibility into transactions. In theory this could provide ephemerality if Spark Operators had a non-logging policy, but in practice all transaction data is currently being published to an explorer by Flashnet, one of the Spark Operators. This means that outside observers can trivially look up Spark addresses and see all transaction details, token balances, and even link Lightning payments to addresses using timing and amount analysis. Note that Spark is working to add the ability for wallet developers to opt-out of this data publishing by marking transactions as private, which then falls back to the same VPN-like trust model as previously described for Ark. If a wallet developer opts to enable this (as I hope they all will!), the Spark Operators will promise not to publish this transaction data publicly, but of course still have the ability to store this data locally if they so choose. Lack of address rotation In its current form, Spark doesn’t support spending funds from multiple distinct Spark addresses in a single transaction. While this is slated to be fixed and already acknowledged as a key shortcoming of Spark, at present it means that most Spark implementations will rely on a single, static address for all transactions, making Spark’s privacy at the moment worse than even on-chain Bitcoin. Combining this address re-use with all amounts being visible means that it would be trivial for an attacker to perform timing + amount heuristics on payments to ascertain which Lightning payments pertain to which Spark addresses. Spark address leaks To complete the trifecta of current privacy problems in Spark, the core SDKs provided by Spark (and used by the most common implementation of Spark in Wallet of Satoshi) by default include the user’s Spark address unnecessarily in BOLT 11 Lightning invoices. This means that anyone can easily decode a provided BOLT 11 invoice and learn every transaction from that user in Spark, thanks to the use of static addresses and all details being published to an explorer as detailed above. Note that this isn’t absolutely necessary, can easily be disabled by wallet developers, and is already removed in the Breez Nodeless SDK that utilizes Spark and is rapidly gaining adoption but is important to callout nonetheless.

While neither is a perfect solution, it’s exciting that wallet developers finally have two competing and interesting options to solve the implementation of Lightning, native tokens, and other functionality into their wallets and software without the complexity traditionally associated with Lightning. Both Spark and Ark present a pragmatic outcome for scaling Bitcoin, representing a hard but sane path to do things in a way that balances trust-minimization with user-experience and scaling. As both are rapidly evolving protocols, the hope is that the tradeoffs presented by both solutions will be rapidly improved upon and minimized in the coming months and years, providing an even better option that gets non-custodial Bitcoin into the hands of many more people while extending the things that we can build on top of Bitcoin. A special thank you to the folks at Spark, Ark Labs, Second, Breez, Spiral, and Bitcoin QnA for taking the time to provide feedback on this article! It takes a tribe to work out all of the trust assumptions and tradeoffs of these novel systems, and I’m extremely grateful to each for taking out some of their valuable time to help here.

      "content": "[Bitcoin Magazine](https://bitcoinmagazine.com)  \n![](https://bitcoinmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/ArkandSpark.webp)  \n[Spark and Ark: A Look At Our Newest Bitcoin Layer Twos](https://bitcoinmagazine.com/technical/spark-and-ark-a-look-at-our-newest-bitcoin-layer-twos)\n\nIn my quest to find the best solution for [Cake Wallet](https://cakewallet.com/) to offer user-friendly, non-custodial Lightning to our users, I’ve gone _deep_ down the rabbit hole of both Spark and Ark. Both are quite novel approaches to Bitcoin layer two networks, and are designed at their core to be interoperable with the broader Bitcoin network for payments via the Lightning Network. While both can be used “just” for Lightning payments, both networks are positioned to rapidly expand and be used for far more than that over the coming months and years.\n\nOne thing to keep in mind is that while Spark and Ark on their face seem rather similar, in practice and in implementation they are quite distinct.\n\nWhy do we need new layer twos?\n------------------------------\n\nBitcoin at its core is an incredible tool for freedom, but due to block size constraints, we know that the majority of the world will never be able to make transactions on-chain. Enter Lightning, a solution that allows one on-chain transaction to allow for essentially infinite off-chain transactions, expanding the usefulness of Bitcoin’s base layer and making it possible for more people to transact.\n\nWhile Lightning provided a promising approach to scaling Bitcoin payments, ultimately the realization that its best role is as an interoperability layer and not as a tool for end-users to run themselves has become clear. On-chain requirements, liquidity management, liveness requirements, and other core hurdles make the implementation of user-friendly, self-custodial Lightning next to impossible. This has become apparent as most Lightning wallets and use-cases have opted to use custodial or federated models out of a need to simplify the user experience and the implementation difficulty.\n\nThe biggest win that Spark and Ark provide to the Bitcoin space out of the gate is providing a much simpler and easier way for the average developer to provide Lightning to their users, while allowing for greatly expanded functionality down the line beyond Lightning payments.\n\nArk, simplified\n---------------\n\n### History\n\nThe concept of Ark was [created in May of 2023](https://x.com/brqgoo/status/1661396915274088448) by Burak, a Lightning advocate and developer. The driving force behind its creation was the realization that the Lightning network as constructed was not effective as an onboarding tool for the average individual due to inbound liquidity requirements among many other things, and that privacy was often lacking. While Burak invented the protocol itself, two companies – [Ark Labs](https://arklabs.xyz/) and [Second](https://second.tech/) – have stepped in to build the Ark protocol into an end-to-end layer-two network for Bitcoin.\n\nWhile both companies are building around the same open-source Ark protocol, their implementations and objectives are rather dissimilar. As a result, I’ll do my best to distill both below where possible.\n\n#### Terminology\n\n**Ark:** Ark is a protocol for moving Bitcoin transactions off-chain by leveraging multisig and pre-signed transactions between users and the Ark Operator. Anything you can do on Bitcoin, you can do on Ark but faster and with lower fees.\n\n**Ark Operator:** The entity running the centralized Ark server infrastructure and responsible for providing liquidity for user’s VTXOs before expiry.\n\n**Lightning Gateway:** The entity that provides the ability for Ark users to send or receive Lightning payments using trustless atomic swaps of Ark VTXOs. This function can be provided by the same entity as the Ark Operator, but is often distinct to spread out counter-party risk.\n\n**Virtual Transaction Outputs:** Also called “VTXOs”, these are very similar to on-chain UTXOs in nature, but are virtual as they aren’t represented as unique UTXOs on-chain and live entirely off-chain. Users send and receive VTXOs within Ark.\n\n**Rounds:** In order to gain true finality and/or refresh VTXOs, Ark users will need to join rounds, where they work together with other Ark users and the Ark Operator to get new VTXOs in exchange for a fee.\n\n### Making transactions\n\nArk functions very similarly to on-chain Bitcoin transactions, and inherits many of the same mannerisms while allowing transactions to be near-instant and trust-minimized between Ark participants. The sender works with the Ark Operator to sign the VTXO over to the recipient, or in the case of Ark Labs to create a new, chained VTXO for the recipient. This allows a user-experience similar in many ways to on-chain payments, but with far lower fees and far faster transaction times. When the user wants to send or receive Lightning payments, they can work with a Lightning Gateway to atomically swap VTXOs for Lightning payments as-needed. At the moment no offline receive for Lightning payments in Ark is possible, but it’s likely this will be solved in a similarly trust-minimized way within Ark as it is in Spark.\n\nIf the user desires finality (i.e. they’ve received a large payment), they can choose to join a round to finalize the payment and gain the same finality assumptions as on-chain Bitcoin. The frequency of this round process will vary by Ark Operator –  with estimates ranging from every 10min to every hour – and requires a relatively lengthy coordinated signing process between all users seeking to join the round with the Ark Operator. The round frequency can even vary based on demand, and is not something that has to be set in stone to a single frequency unlike Bitcoin block times.\n\nAs Ark inherits Bitcoin scripting and the UTXO model directly from on-chain Bitcoin, Ark will likely be extended to support token protocols like Taproot Assets in the future.\n\n### Trust tradeoffs\n\nArk targets a very trust-minimized approach to scaling Bitcoin, striking something of a middle-ground in terms of usability and tradeoffs between Lightning and Spark. Note that Ark as a protocol is rapidly developing, and some of these tradeoffs will hopefully be solved through the use of novel off-chain methods or after the implementation of [covenants](https://bitcoinmagazine.com/featured/bitcoin-covenants-what-are-they-and-what-do-they-do) in Bitcoin.\n\n#### Lack of out-of-round finality\n\nWhile Spark lacks provable finality, Ark strikes something of a middle ground. For small payments, users can rely on the Ark Operator and previous senders to not collude for security, allowing for instant transfers with no need for collaborative signing rounds. Note that by default, payments within Ark will be “out-of-round” payments that lack true finality, a tradeoff that allows Ark to deliver a good user experience out of the box.\n\nThat being said, users who do need or want true finality can have it by joining a round and receiving a new VTXO from the Ark Operator. Receivers are essentially in control of their preferred trust model.\n\n#### VTXO expiration\n\nAs a result of the liquidity requirements to operate an Ark instance, Ark Operators need a way to reclaim liquidity regularly. To allow this liquidity reclamation, Ark VTXOs will expire regularly (i.e. after 30d, with the VTXO expiry being set by each Ark Operator), requiring their owners to either join a round to refresh the VTXO or risk giving up control of their funds entirely to the Ark Operator. While the Ark Operator has strong incentives to merely issue a new VTXO to the owner of the expired one when they come back online, both the Ark Operator and the user will have the ability to spend funds until a new VTXO is issued to the user.\n\nTo avoid funds expiring, users will be required to refresh their VTXOs within that window either directly or [by offloading refresh to a delegate](http://blog.arklabs.xyz/adios-expiry-rethinking-liveness-and-liquidity-in-arkade/). Alternatively, atomic swaps of an expiring VTXO for one with a longer lifecycle could be done with an entity like [Boltz](https://boltz.exchange/) for a fee, but that is not yet implemented.\n\n#### Complex round user experience\n\nIf you’ve ever used Coinjoin on Bitcoin, you know how tedious and unreliable collaboratively signing a transaction with other Bitcoiners can be. In Ark, those seeking true finality for their VTXOs will need to be available throughout a round signing process until its completion, something that will depend heavily on other participants properly completing the signing process. While this is quite trivial to accomplish for a wallet running on an always-online server, it’s rather complex to reliably perform on mobile platforms, especially iOS where no background execution (and thus no ability to be online at the right time for signing) can be guaranteed for any app.\n\nAs a result of this complex user experience, Ark Labs have come up with [a system](http://blog.arklabs.xyz/adios-expiry-rethinking-liveness-and-liquidity-in-arkade/) that leverages delegated third parties performing the refresh in a trust-minimized way for users, offloading the liveliness requirement to a third party.

      "summary": "Bitcoin Magazine Why the Bitcoin Price May Be Decoupling From Its Four-Year Cycle Has the bitcoin price finally broken away from its four-year cycle pattern, or is this bull market already entering exhaustion? By studying historical growth rates, liquidity data, and macroeconomic correlations, we can better understand whether the current cycle has truly diverged, and what that means for investors in the months ahead. Bitcoin Price Cycle Duration Analyzing BTC Growth Since Cycle Lows, we can see that Bitcoin has now officially surpassed the elapsed time from cycle low to cycle high seen in previous bull markets. The 2018–2022 cycle peaked 1,059 days after its prior bear market low, and the current cycle has now moved beyond that duration. If we average the elapsed time across the last two full market cycles, Bitcoin has already exceeded the historical mean and is on the verge of surpassing even the 2017 cycle length in the coming days. Figure 1: BTC Growth Since Cycle Lows illustrates that the duration of the current cycle is surpassing the previous two 4-year cycles. View Live Chart Diminishing Impact on Bitcoin Price Historically, Bitcoin’s four-year cycle was rooted in its halving events, where the block reward, and thus the inflation rate, was cut in half. Each halving triggered a sharp supply shock, driving major bull markets. However, this cycle has behaved differently. Following the most recent halving, Bitcoin experienced five months of sideways consolidation rather than the explosive post-halving rallies seen previously. While price has since made notable gains, momentum has been weaker, leading many to ask whether the halving has lost its influence. Figure 2: Bitcoin’s Circulating Supply and the diminishing marginal inflation impact. View Live Chart With the current Circulating Supply already exceeding 95% of the 21 million ultimate total supply of Bitcoin, the marginal supply reduction may no longer be as significant. Today, miners distribute roughly 450 newly created BTC per day, an amount easily absorbed by a handful of institutional buyers or ETFs. That means the halving alone may no longer be the dominant driver of Bitcoin’s market cycles. Global Liquidity Cycles Driving the Bitcoin Price When we view Global M2 Money Supply versus BTC on a year-on-year basis, a clear pattern emerges. Each major Bitcoin bottom has aligned almost perfectly with the trough of Global M2 liquidity growth. Figure 3: Global M2 versus BTC (YoY) has historically aligned practically perfectly. View Live Chart If we map the Bitcoin halvings and the M2 troughs side by side, we see that halvings typically lag the liquidity cycle, suggesting that liquidity expansion, not halving events, may be the true catalyst for Bitcoin’s rallies. This isn’t unique to Bitcoin. Gold has shown the same behavior for decades, with its price performance closely mirroring the rate of Global M2 expansion or contraction. Inverse Correlations Shaping Bitcoin Price Trends A key part of this liquidity story lies in the U.S. Dollar Strength Index (DXY). Historically, BTC versus DXY on a year-on-year basis has been almost perfectly inversely correlated. When the dollar strengthens year-on-year, Bitcoin tends to enter bear market conditions. When the dollar weakens, Bitcoin begins a new bull market. This inverse relationship also holds true for Gold and equity markets, underscoring the broader debasement cycle thesis that as fiat currencies lose purchasing power, hard assets rapidly appreciate. Figure 4: BTC vs. DXY (YoY) and the strong inverse correlation with major market turns. View Live Chart Currently, the DXY has been in a short-term uptrend, coinciding with Bitcoin’s recent consolidation. However, the index is now approaching a key historical resistance zone, one that has previously marked major turning points and preceded prolonged DXY declines. If this pattern holds, the next major drop in dollar strength could trigger a renewed upcycle for Bitcoin. Quantitative Tightening and the Bitcoin Price Comments from Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell recently hinted that the era of balance sheet contraction (quantitative tightening) may be nearing an end. Looking at the Fed Balance Sheet versus BTC, the start of balance sheet expansion and renewed quantitative easing has historically coincided with major upward moves in Bitcoin and equity markets alike. Figure 5: Fed Balance Sheet inflection points historically align with Bitcoin bull cycle expansions. View Live Chart During the two years following previous Fed balance sheet expansions, the S&P 500 averaged a 47% return, more than five times the average two-year performance during neutral periods. If we are indeed entering a new easing phase, it could not only prolong Bitcoin’s current cycle but also set the stage for a liquidity-driven melt-up across risk assets. Conclusion: The Evolving Bitcoin Price Cycle Bitcoin has now outlasted the timeframes of its previous two cycles, leading many to question whether the four-year rhythm still applies. But when we step back, a different narrative emerges, one driven not by programmed scarcity, but by Global liquidity, fiat debasement, and macro capital flow. The “four-year cycle” may not be broken, but it may have simply evolved. If the U.S. Dollar weakens, the Fed pauses tightening, and Global M2 growth accelerates, then Bitcoin likely still has room to run. For now, as always, the best approach remains the same: react, don’t predict. Stay data-driven, stay patient, and keep your eyes on liquidity.

      "summary": "Bitcoin Magazine Bitcoin Price Jumps to $111,000 as Softer CPI Data Fuels Rate-Cut Bets Bitcoin price surged past $111,000 today after new U.S. inflation data showed a milder-than-expected rise in consumer prices, strengthening expectations that the Federal Reserve will move ahead with additional rate cuts this year. The Consumer Price Index (CPI) rose 0.3% month-over-month in September, below economists’ forecasts of 0.4%, while “core” CPI — excluding food and energy — rose just 0.2%, also softer than expected. On a year-over-year basis, both headline and core inflation registered 3.0%, slightly below estimates. The release, delayed 10 days by the ongoing government shutdown, was one of the few major economic reports to make it out this month. An exception was made due to a legal requirement for the Social Security Administration to publish its annual cost-of-living adjustment. The data reaffirmed market expectations for a 25 basis point rate cut at next week’s Federal Reserve meeting and another in December, which would bring the policy rate down to a 3.75–4.00% range. On Polymarket, there is a 97% that of a 25 basis point cut next week. BREAKING: US inflation rises to 3%, lower than expectations. — Bitcoin Magazine (@BitcoinMagazine) October 24, 2025 That being said, White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt praised Friday’s CPI report for coming in below expectations but warned that the ongoing government shutdown could prevent the release of October’s inflation data next week All other economic reports remain paused due to the shutdown that began October 1. Treasury yields slipped and the dollar weakened following the release, while the Nasdaq 100 added nearly 1%. For Bitcoin, the softer CPI print provided fresh fuel for the rally that began earlier in the week, lifting the asset higher in early Friday trading. Bitcoin price this week Bitcoin dipped around $107,000 earlier this week as analysts from VanEck and Standard Chartered maintained a bullish outlook despite recent volatility. Standard Chartered’s Geoffrey Kendrick predicted a brief dip below $100,000 soon amid U.S.–China tensions but saw it as a final buying opportunity before a rebound toward $200,000 by year-end. VanEck’s ChainCheck report described October’s 18% correction as a liquidity-driven mid-cycle reset, not a bear market. Analysts noted normalized leverage, strengthening macro demand, and growing institutional activity. VanEck said deleveraging cleared speculative excess, creating entry opportunities as Bitcoin’s role as an “anti–money printing” asset deepened. Bitcoin’s current price is about 13% below its peak of roughly $126,000, reached earlier in October on October 6, 2025.

      "summary": "Bitcoin Magazine Alpha Arena Reveals AI Trading Flaws: Western Models Lose 80% Capital in One Week Can AI trade crypto? Jay Azhang, a computer engineer and finance bro from New York, is putting this question to the test with Alpha Arena. The project pits the greatest large language models (LLM) against each other, each with 10 thousand dollars worth of capital, to see which can make more money trading crypto. The models include Grok 4, Claude Sonnet 4.5, Gemini 2.5 pro, ChatGPT 5, Deepseek v3.1, and Qwen3 Max. Now, you might be thinking “wow, that’s a great idea!” and you would be surprised, at the time of writing, three out of the five AIs are underwater, with Qwen3 and Deepseek — the two Chinese open source models — leading the charge. That’s right, the western world’s most powerful, closed source, proprietary artificial intelligences run by giants like Google and OpenAI, have lost over $8,000 dollars, 80% of their crypto trading capital in little over a week, while their eastern open source counterparts are in the green. The most successful trade so far? Qwen3 — moisturised and in its lane — with a simple 20x bitcoin long position. Grok 4 — to no one’s surprise — has been long Doge with 10x leverage for most of the competition… having at one point been at the top of the charts along with Deepseek, now close to 20% underwater. Maybe Elon Musk should tweet a doge meme or something to, you know, get Grok out of the dog house. Meanwhile, Google’s Gemini is relentlessly bearish, being short on all the crypto assets available to trade, a position that echoes their general crypto policy over the past 15 years. Last but not least is ChatGibitty, which has made every bad trade possible for a week straight, a remarkable achievement! It takes skill to be that bad, especially when Qwen3 just longed bitcoin and went fishing. If this is the best closed-source AI has to offer, then maybe OpenAI should just keep it closed source and spare us. A new benchmark for AI All joking aside, the idea of pitting off AI models against each other in a crypto trading arena has some very profound insights. For starters, AI can not be pre-trained on answers to knowledge tests with crypto trading since it is so unpredictable, an issue that other benchmarks suffer from. To put it another way, many AI models are being given the answers to some of these tests in their training, and so of course they perform well when tested. But some research has demonstrated that slight changes to some of these tests lead to radically different AI benchmark results. This controversy begs the question: What is the ultimate test of intelligence? Well, according to Elon Musk, Iron Man enthusiast and creator of Grok 4, predicting the future is the ultimate measure of intelligence. The ability to predict the future is the best measure of intelligence https://t.co/W6WriRGt9N — Elon Musk (@elonmusk) September 5, 2025 And let’s face it, there’s no future more uncertain than the short-term price of crypto. In the words of Azhang, “Our goal with Alpha Arena is to make benchmarks more like the real world, and markets are perfect for this. They’re dynamic, adversarial, open-ended, and endlessly unpredictable. They challenge AI in ways that static benchmarks cannot. — Markets are the ultimate test of intelligence.” This insight about markets is deeply embedded in the libertarian principles from which Bitcoin was born. Economists like Murray Rothbard and Milton Friedman made the case over a hundred years ago that markets were fundamentally unpredictable by central planners, that only individuals making real economic decisions with something to lose could make rational economic calculations. In other words, the market is the most difficult thing to predict as it depends on the individual perspectives and decisions of intelligent individuals throughout the world, and thus, it is the best test of intelligence. Azhang mentions in its project description that the AIs are instructed to trade not just for gains, but for risk-adjusted returns. This risk dimension is critical, as one bad trade can wipe out all previous returns, as seen, for example, in the downfall of Grok 4’s portfolio. There’s another question that remains, which is whether these models are learning from their experience trading crypto, a matter that is not technically easy to achieve, given that AI models are very expensive to pre-train in the first place. They could be fine-tuned with their own trading history or other people’s history, and they might even keep recent trades in their short-term memory or context window, but that can only take them so far. Ultimately, the right AI trading model might have to really learn from its own experiences, a technology that was recently announced among academic circles but has a long way to go before it becomes a product. MIT calls them self-adaptating AI models. How do we know it is not just luck? Another analysis of the project and its results so far is that it may be indistinguishable from a ‘random walk’. A random walk is akin to throwing dice for every decision. What would that look like on a chart? Well, there’s actually a simulator you can use to answer that question; it would not look too different, actually. This question of luck in markets has also been described quite carefully by intellectuals like Nassim Taleb in his book Antifragile. In it, he argues that from the perspective of statistics, it is perfectly normal and possible for one trader, say Qwen3 in this case, to be lucky for a whole week straight! Leading to the appearance of superior reasoning. Taleb goes a lot further than that, arguing that there are enough traders on Wall Street that one of them could easily be lucky for 20 years in a row, developing a god-like reputation, with everyone around them assuming this trader is just a genius, until, of course, luck runs out. Thus, for Alpha Arena to produce valuable data, it will actually have to run for a long time, and its patterns and results will need to be replicated independently as well, with real capital at stake, before they can be identified as different than a random walk. Ultimately, it’s great to see the open-source, cost-efficient models like DeepSeek outperform their closed-source counterparts so far. Alpha Arena has so far been a great source of entertainment, as it has gone viral on X.com over the past week. Where it goes is anyone’s guess; we will have to see if the gamble its creator took, giving $50,000 to five chatbots to gamble on crypto with, pays off in the end.

Grok 4 — to no one’s surprise — has been long Doge with 10x leverage for most of the competition… having at one point been at the top of the charts along with Deepseek, now close to 20% underwater.  Maybe Elon Musk should tweet a doge meme or something to, you know, get Grok out of the dog house. \n\n![Alpha Arena Reveals AI Trading Flaws: Western Models Lose 80% Capital in One Week](https://bitcoinmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/image-32-1024x380.png \"Alpha Arena Reveals AI Trading Flaws: Western Models Lose 80% Capital in One Week 2\")\n\nMeanwhile, Google’s Gemini is relentlessly bearish, being short on all the crypto assets available to trade, a position that echoes their general crypto policy over the past 15 years. \n\nLast but not least is ChatGibitty, which has made every bad trade possible for a week straight, a remarkable achievement! It takes skill to be that bad, especially when Qwen3 just longed bitcoin and went fishing. If this is the best closed-source AI has to offer, then maybe OpenAI should just keep it closed source and spare us.  \n  \n![](blob:https://bitcoinmagazine.com/b32b6624-fab5-424d-af6d-bc9765d31be9 \"Alpha Arena Reveals AI Trading Flaws: Western Models Lose 80% Capital in One Week 3\")\n\n### A new benchmark for AI\n\nAll joking aside, the idea of pitting off AI models against each other in a crypto trading arena has some very profound insights. For starters, AI can not be pre-trained on answers to knowledge tests with crypto trading since it is so unpredictable, an issue that other benchmarks suffer from. To put it another way, many AI models are being given the answers to some of these tests in their training, and so of course they perform well when tested. But some research has demonstrated that [slight changes to some of these tests lead to radically different AI benchmark results](https://arstechnica.com/ai/2024/10/llms-cant-perform-genuine-logical-reasoning-apple-researchers-suggest/).\n\nThis controversy begs the question: What is the ultimate test of intelligence? Well, according to Elon Musk, Iron Man enthusiast and creator of Grok 4, predicting the future is the ultimate measure of intelligence. \n\n> The ability to predict the future is the best measure of intelligence [https://t.co/W6WriRGt9N](https://t.co/W6WriRGt9N)\n> \n> — Elon Musk (@elonmusk) [September 5, 2025](https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1963877113049580023?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw)\n\nAnd let’s face it, there’s no future more uncertain than the short-term price of crypto. In the words of Azhang, “Our goal with Alpha Arena is to make benchmarks more like the real world, and markets are perfect for this. They’re dynamic, adversarial, open-ended, and endlessly unpredictable. They challenge AI in ways that static benchmarks cannot. — Markets are the ultimate test of intelligence.” \n\nThis insight about markets is deeply embedded in the libertarian principles from which Bitcoin was born. Economists like Murray Rothbard and Milton Friedman made the case over a hundred years ago that markets were fundamentally unpredictable by central planners, that only individuals making real economic decisions with something to lose could make rational economic calculations.\n\nIn other words, the market is the most difficult thing to predict as it depends on the individual perspectives and decisions of intelligent individuals throughout the world, and thus, it is the best test of intelligence.\n\nAzhang mentions in its project description that the AIs are instructed to trade not just for gains, but for risk-adjusted returns. This risk dimension is critical, as one bad trade can wipe out all previous returns, as seen, for example, in the downfall of Grok 4’s portfolio. \n\nThere’s another question that remains, which is whether these models are learning from their experience trading crypto, a matter that is not technically easy to achieve, given that AI models are very expensive to pre-train in the first place. They could be fine-tuned with their own trading history or other people’s history, and they might even keep recent trades in their short-term memory or context window, but that can only take them so far. Ultimately, the right AI trading model might have to really learn from its own experiences, a technology that was recently announced among academic circles but has a long way to go before it becomes a product. MIT calls them [self-adaptating AI models](https://jyopari.github.io/posts/seal). \n\n### How do we know it is not just luck? \n\nAnother analysis of the project and its results so far is that it may be indistinguishable from a ‘random walk’. A random walk is akin to throwing dice for every decision. What would that look like on a chart? Well, there’s actually [a simulator you can use to answer that question](https://demonstrations.wolfram.com/SimulatingTheSimpleRandomWalk/); it would not look too different, actually. \n\n![Alpha Arena Reveals AI Trading Flaws: Western Models Lose 80% Capital in One Week](https://bitcoinmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/image-31.png \"Alpha Arena Reveals AI Trading Flaws: Western Models Lose 80% Capital in One Week 4\")\n\nThis question of luck in markets has also been described quite carefully by intellectuals like Nassim Taleb in his book Antifragile. In it, he argues that from the perspective of statistics, it is perfectly normal and possible for one trader, say Qwen3 in this case, to be lucky for a whole week straight! Leading to the appearance of superior reasoning. Taleb goes a lot further than that, arguing that there are enough traders on Wall Street that one of them could easily be lucky for 20 years in a row, developing a god-like reputation, with everyone around them assuming this trader is just a genius, until, of course, luck runs out. \n\nThus, for Alpha Arena to produce valuable data, it will actually have to run for a long time, and its patterns and results will need to be replicated independently as well, with real capital at stake, before they can be identified as different than a random walk.  \n  \nUltimately, it’s great to see the open-source, cost-efficient models like DeepSeek outperform their closed-source counterparts so far. Alpha Arena has so far been a great source of entertainment, as it has gone viral on X.com over the past week. Where it goes is anyone’s guess; we will have to see if the gamble its creator took, giving $50,000 to five chatbots to gamble on crypto with, pays off in the end. \n\nThis post [Alpha Arena Reveals AI Trading Flaws: Western Models Lose 80% Capital in One Week](https://bitcoinmagazine.com/business/alpha-arena-reveals-ai-trading-flaws-western-models-lose-80-capital-in-one-week) first appeared on [Bitcoin Magazine](https://bitcoinmagazine.com) and is written by [Juan Galt](https://bitcoinmagazine.com/authors/juan-galt).",

The Zurich-based firm announced today that it has been granted authorization as a Crypto-Asset Service Provider (CASP) by France’s Financial Markets Authority (AMF), according to a note shared with Bitcoin Magazine. The approval marks a significant moment not just for Relai, but for the broader Bitcoin ecosystem in Europe. The MiCA regulation, which came into effect earlier this year, establishes uniform rules for crypto companies across the EU, aiming to increase investor protection and reduce regulatory fragmentation between member states. While large exchanges like Binance and Coinbase are still navigating the complex licensing process, Relai’s early authorization gives it a head start as one of the first Bitcoin-only firms to achieve compliance. “We’re incredibly proud to be one of the first Bitcoin companies to get the MiCA license and are eager to expand to France first — and Europe in a second step,” said Julian Liniger, co-founder and CEO of Relai. “This is a big moment for Bitcoin adoption on the continent.” Relai is expanding a bitcoin-only vision across Europe Founded in Zurich in 2020, Relai has grown despite a rough regulatory environment for digital assets. The company closed a Series A funding round last year and surpassed 500,000 app downloads, establishing itself as a user-friendly gateway for European retail investors seeking exposure to Bitcoin without intermediaries. With the MiCA license secured, Relai can now “passport” its services across the EU — meaning it can operate in all 27 member states once formal notification procedures are complete. The company plans to introduce a suite of new features tailored to European users, including Instant SEPA payments, higher trading limits, fixed-price transparency, and enhanced security standards. Relai also intends to invest in education and community-building, launching localized learning resources and sponsoring Bitcoin events across Europe. “Our goal is clear: bringing Bitcoin to as many people as possible — simple, secure, and regulated,” said Adem Bilican, co-founder and president of Relai EU.

      "title": "OrangePilling The Early Majority",
      "summary": "A detailed guide I believe that the most important action that Bitcoiners can take, which is not currently being taken with enough focus/skill, is to improve the way we communicate the value of Bitcoin to the next wave of Bitcoin adopters. These people are the “early majority”. They care about different things to the early adopters. If we fail to do this, Bitcoin adoption will be top heavy insofar as Corporates and Nation States start building their Bitcoin reserve, but the everyday people are left behind, not seeing the value-alignment of Bitcoin with their own value-set. There’s also a risk that even institutional adoption will be slow across many nations, where the values of the investment fund are in apparent but not actual conflict with Bitcoin. This paper lays out my first attempt at a remedy to address this. Introduction What are the blockers that could stop us moving from the early adopters into the early majority of Bitcoin adopters? There are many factors, and the answer often depends on the audience. For example, for pension funds the blockers have been “the fact that none of my peers are doing it” and ESG. For the general population, it’s often “I don’t know where to start”, or “It’s not straightforward to get Bitcoin in the first place, and how do I get it to and from my bank?” For liberals it is almost always, “It’s bad for the environment and/or it does nothing useful”. Today I’m going to take a step back and look at an element of adoption that is critically important, yet not widely understood: how we pitch Bitcoin to a community of people. Yes, what we say, and having the charts, data, information and education is important. But even more important is knowing how to present this information to skeptics. My intention is that this document serves as a resource for others to help you orangepill more regulators, policymakers, boards, fund managers and, most importantly, retail investors to adopt Bitcoin, or at least adopt a friendly stance towards Bitcoin. Why this; why now? This document open sources a lot of the strategies that I’ve used to orangepill skeptics to Bitcoin. While this post focuses mostly on the environmental and humanitarian benefits to Bitcoin, the principles can be applied to any Bitcoin topic where you’re seeking to orangepill someone. When I look at the disparity between how the early adopters were convinced to embrace Bitcoin, and how the early majority need to be spoken to in order to come to Bitcoin, I see a danger that we will ostracize many potential future advocates through sloppy attempts at orangepilling that are not just ineffective but in many cases counter-productive. I believe that ending orangepilling naivety will be critical as ending regulatory hostility when it comes to the next wave of Bitcoin adoption. While some have said that I have changed the narrative on Bitcoin and energy, I am most definitely not the only person who has shifted the narrative, nor am I the most important person. There is at least one person who has objectively done more than me to orangepill key globally recognized figures on the ESG merits of Bitcoin (in many cases ESG was the blocker for them embracing Bitcoin). This person wishes to remain anonymous. In this post, I cite numerous examples of where people have gotten a positive outcome through adopted my orange-pilling techniques. My intention in sharing this is not to glorify anything I have done, but to evidence the effectiveness of certain ways of communicating that over time, and through the help of some great mentors, I have found to be effective. While in a tech-centric industry such as Bitcoin, it is easy to think this is because of the BEEST data model of sustainable energy usage and other long form research I conducted, I would say that the data model was 30% of what mattered, but the other 70% was how I put together messages differently using other people’s research. This is something that can be learnt and replicated using many of the seven principals of effective orangepilling described below. Finally, to those who wonder “Isn’t there a chance that by open-sourcing these strategies, these can be weaponized against Bitcoin?” No. Because everything I describe here only works if you have truth and fact on your side, have domain knowledge in the area you are speaking, and are communicating as an act of service to others without agenda or attachment. Why am I qualified to write about this? Results are the only qualification. But in case you are interested, it’s an area I did some work in before in my pre-Bitcoin days. Orangepilling is a truncated way of saying “successfully pitching Bitcoin” and pitching is something a little bit about having written a book on it. Before that, I coached tech entrepreneurs in pitching. Before that, I also led a technology company through three cap raises, where I had to learn a lot about pitching in a hurry! Those pre-Bitcoin experiences gave me a sense of what needed to be done between 2022-2023 to start to change the mainstream narrative around Bitcoin & Energy. This post looks at lessons we can all pull from what worked, when it comes to orangepilling the next wave of Bitcoin adopters. Your lived experience makes you uniquely qualified to talk to your tribe I first became aware of this watching Michael Saylor talk about the energy consumption of Bitcoin during a quarterly Bitcoin Mining Council update. Michael Saylor is one of Bitcoin’s most gifted communicators. He inspires me to improve my own communication. He is inspiring, lucid, visionary, yet at the same time able to back up his statements with solid data and examples. I will never forget the brilliant way he cut across a podcaster who suggested that it was risky being “all in on Bitcoin”, with the question “Are you all in on the chair you’re sitting on?” So it was with intrigue that on the question of why Bitcoin is a strong ESG asset, he was the least compelling I’d seen him. The reason was simple: the environment is “not his thing”. He is absolutely the right person to convince billionaires, millionaires, boards of corporations, and a large number of early adopters to get into Bitcoin. He is not the right person to convince the early majority of liberal retail investors, ESG investment committees at Sovereign Funds and Pension Funds why Bitcoin is a great ESG asset. This is true for the simple reason that this isn’t who he is. Each of us have a community of people we will vibe with, who we understand deeply. This gives us a special and unique responsibility to orange-pill this community of people. It is quite probable that there are certain people who can only come to understand and use Bitcoin through you. That said, there are some universal principles we can apply that will make us more effective at orange-pilling people who are adjacent to our community, even if they are not exactly “our tribe”. Seven principles of effective orange-pilling 1. Meet people where they are This sounds simple, so simple that it is often skipped over. Yet it is 50% of how influence occurs. Let’s look at a real example. How do you feel as a Bitcoin supporter when you read this tweet? My bet it is is some combination of frustrated, exasperated or bored and irate. Yes, the comment is ignorant. Yes, the comment is also arguably arrogant, because the writer has assumed that s/he knows Bitcoin’s utility without having investigated bitcoin’s utility. It is also flawed, because the vast majority of contemporary research on Bitcoin mining shows that Bitcoin is an important part of climate action. However, neither the emotions you feel, nor the facts you know have any relevance to the other person, if your intention is to help them look at other perspectives. What it comes down to is the question “what do I want?” If what you want is a chance to offload and give this person a piece of your mind, then you will respond the way that most people do on Twitter, get a quick endorphin hit of saying your piece. But what did you achieve? Very little. If anything, all you’ve done is help calcify a belief in the other party that Bitcoiners are obnoxious. But what if your intention was different. What if your intention was to plant a seed that blows the person’s mind, that speaks to their latent intellectual curiosity. What if your intention was to invite dialog, or even to invite them in a non-confronting way to help them see the gaps in their knowledge? Then you’d choose a different response. I optimize for “what response is most likely to orange-pill them?” There is no spin, no manipulation at play. My intention is to help the person learn, but only if they are curious. If they are not, then I respect that too. For that reason, I also test whether they are open to learning, and if not to politely move on. That’s more efficient with my time, it avoids squandering my emotional energy, and it’s more respectful of the other person. How I responded on that occasion was like this. Why is this an effective response? Because I had no attachment to how or whether s/he responded. Everything I said was true. I’m meeting the person where they are at. I’m not making them wrong for holding their beliefs. I’m suggesting, without accusing, that their beliefs may be held in ignorance (as mine were), I’m not assuming interest in taking the conversation further, and I’m placing a fork in the road which implicitly says “If you want to continue the conversation, it’s to learn, not to debate.” It’s also effective because it challenges a probable belief the person has (judging from their tweet) which is: “It’s not possible to be both an environmentalist and a bitcoin supporter.” So while it was a spontaneous response that I took perhaps 30 seconds to type, there is a lot going on “under the hood”. Meeting people where they are at is not an “optional extra” to orange pilling the skeptical, but an essential stage. To understand the essential nature of this is not just my opinion, but something with a scientific basis, lets go into the weeds briefly on what is happening neurobiologically which makes this stage essential. Neuropsychology research suggests that responding in a way that shows empathy and understanding of the other person’s position, even if we do not agree with it, aids Emotional Regulation, Social Cohesion, Cognitive Flexibility, Diminishing Threat Response, and even the Mirror Neuron System between two individuals. This response also stops the negative neurobiological chain reaction that occurs when a person is faced with disagreement, or the threat of disagreement. Disagreement, or even the threat of disagreement, causes fight of flight hormones to be released, as the other party is preparing for a fight, albeit a verbal one. This triggers the release of cortisol which increases the blood flow to the extremities ready to take evasive action (either aggressive or defensive), at the cost of where it is deemed less necessary; the cerebral cortex. Even though the threat is a verbal fight, not a physical one, our internal neurobiology is not sophisticated enough to know the difference: it perceives a threat and so responds to that threat with the hormones necessary to preserve life, cortisol, so we can “run faster”. What is the cerebral cortex responsible for? Reasoning and logic, as well as creative thinking. What faculties need to be receptive in order for your logic to be received? Reasoning and logic, and creative thinking. By identifying with the person’s right to hold their view, and empathy for why they would have come to that conclusion, we are sending a verbal signal to their fight or flight response “hey, it’s OK, I’m not here to fight.” The other person takes a deep breath and relaxes, the stress response eases, and the cerebral cortex becomes capable of hearing your logic, and thinking creatively again. Now, your logic stands a chance of being heard. But until then, you have as much chance of having your thought-seeds germinate as you do of getting literal seeds to germinate by scattering them on barren soil. Empathy waters the soil of consciousness in which thought seeds can germinate. Interestingly, it is not agreement the other person is looking for but understanding of their position. This is how leaders are able to challenge people while remaining in empathy. A weak leader will capitulate, or partially capitulate, to the demands or perspective of the other in an attempt to maintain rapport. A tough leader will stand firm, at the cost of rapport. A strong leader will stand strong in their conviction and in their rapport with the other person. This is not just theory, this is something I put to practice on a regular basis. As well as meaning I can be more influential, it also makes life less stressful. Another time I used this approach was when I was meeting with one of our wholesale investors into my second climatetech fund. He started the conversation by asking what I’d been up to in the months since we last met. I responded “I’ve been researching bitcoin mining.” His entire body language stiffened. “I thought you were a climatetech investor” he said as he unconsciously crossed his arms without any softening hint of irony or tease in his tone. I paused, looked him in the eye, and smiled. “Well, I can understand why you would respond like that” I offered. “That was what I thought when I first looked at it.” He softened his stance a little. I continued. “And this is an area I’ve spent some time researching now. It sounds as though you have some perspectives on mining yourself. If you’d like to, you can share them and I can shed light on them if I’m able.” He completely changed his demeanour and started speaking in a calm voice again, mentioning three fundamental reasons why he felt bitcoin mining was bad for the environment. I checked I’d heard correctly, then said “Well, these are areas I have looked in to, would you like me to share what I’ve found out?” “Go ahead” he replied with more curiosity than skepticism now in his voice. I responded to each of the points in turn. He asked one clarifying question about one of the areas. Then there was silence. It was the silence of someone who is rewiring their neurons for a completely different belief system, and almost perplexed that it could have happened so fast, especially when they were half-expecting a fight. “Well, have you thought about making your third climatetech fund a Bitcoin mining fund?” He asked, again without a hint of tease or irony. The conversation isn’t always as immediately transformative as that, but that serves as an example of what is possible through empathy, and understanding. Equally, if I didn’t have the domain knowledge to answer his specific objections, I could not have completed the orangepilling. 2. Mindset matters Particularly, your intention matters. The second and equally important part of the initial response is “mindset”. If you are still feeling any residual emotions of frustration, anger or exasperation when you speak, or even write, this is a virtual guarantee that your message will betray those emotions. In betraying those emotions, you have again made your communication about yourself, not the other person: ie. what you want to say, not what the other person is in a position to receive from you. Information is like water. You can hand someone a glass of water, or you can throw the contents of the glass over them. Same water (information), but different manner of delivery. Adjusting the mindset is akin to adjusting the angle you hold the glass at, so that it is balanced and that they can benefit from the content, not tilted so that it spills over them and they are aggrieved. Notice that in talking about the most important aspects of orange-pilling people, I haven’t even mentioned Bitcoin other than to use examples, which could have been non-Bitcoin examples, to illustrate a Bitcoin-independent point. Read that last sentence again slowly. That means that influence has more to do with how you communicate than what you actually say. Yep. As I say, a great delivery, framing and mindset without domain knowledge wont work either. But it is often better than intimate domain knowledge with a rough delivery and aggrieved mindset, which is often counter-productive and only serves to entrench a person’s original position. 3. Quantify, quantify, quantify When you are pitching an idea, you are telling a story. What do all stories have in common? A narrative arc, and … details. We tend to forget the second part. Stories paint a detailed picture with sharp edges that we can visualize. JK Rowling didn’t say “Harry Potter lived in a house in England”, she painted the visual picture of the details of Number 4 Privet Drive and the suburban surrounds, so we can picture it. When we are pitching an idea, these details matter more, not less. Why? Neurobiological facts about all humans Negativity bias Humans, in the presence of a lack of clarity, must assume in the negative. Early in our evolution if you saw a large animal on the horizon, and it was unclear whether it was your food or you were its food, negativity bias dictates that you run away from it, not towards it because the negative consequence if you are wrong is that you go hungry, whereas if you assume in the positive and you are wrong, you get eaten. Humans therefore are hardwired neurobiologically to take evasive action in the presence of unclear data. So when you say “Bitcoin is using more sustainable energy now”, or “Bitcoin helps refugees migrate with their life savings intact”, or “even “there are a number of peer reviewed articles on Bitcoin that say it has positive environmental benefits” – you have not given the other person clear data. These are examples of the statements I used to hear a lot in 2022 when I was first trying to understand whether Bitcoin was net-positive or net-negative to the environment. The problem is, without quantified details, the other person will interpret the first statement as “According to you, Bitcoin uses marginally more sustainable energy, but it’s still less than other industries and is still mostly fossil fuel based”. They will interpret the second statement as “There has been the odd isolated case of refugees taking Bitcoin across the border and using it in a new country, but it could have been any type of digital currency”. They will read the third statement as “The vast bulk of peer reviewed articles say Bitcoin is an environmental disaster, but this pro-Bitcoiner standing in front of me has cherrypicked two counter-examples, probably written by bag-holders.” Sharp details bring the big animal into focus. Instead say “We now have four years of data showing that Bitcoin has reached 56.7% sustainable energy use, more than any other industry.” Say “It is estimated that Bitcoin has already helped 329,000 refugees set up financially and preserved their wealth in a new country.” For good measure you could add “over the next ten years, there will be an estimated 9.2 Million refugees who use Bitcoin to help re-establish themselves financially in their new country” Say “The majority of contemporary academic research on Bitcoin and energy show, 12 of the last 14 peer reviewed papers, show that Bitcoin has strong, quantifiable environmental benefits that can help counteract climate change and decarbonize the grid.” In 2022, a lot of the sustainability data I needed to orangepill people who had ESG objections to Bitcoin didn’t exist, so I set about building a model to measure Bitcoin’s sustainable energy use. That took a long time, and I don’t recommend that as a strategy unless you have a lot of time, a strong calling, and really like building data models! But definitely use the data that other people have created, just use it in a well quantified form so you do not squander the effectiveness of their proof of work through a hazily quantified delivery. Based on the results, which included the Financial times picking up a number of my quantified messages, this seems to work. Many plebs and mining companies over the past two years thanked me for my work, but I didn’t create most of the data apart from the BEEST model. The bulk of my work involved creating better qualified messages that reflected existing work. For example, apart from a co-author role on one paper, I didn’t write any of the peer reviewed research on Bitcoin, I was simply the first one to add up how many recent papers described environmental benefits. The “majority of contemporary research on Bitcoin and energy cites environmental benefits”, and “10 of the last 11 papers on Bitcoin and energy shows strong environmental benefits” soundbite are simple, powerful, and easy for other people to share with others. It stops critics in their tracks because they probably didn’t know that, and it’s hard to argue with. The other thing I did was summarize a one-two sentence synopsis of the key findings of each paper, with references to the original paper. This I have found stops critics in their tracks. Such is the power of quantifying a message. At a Bitcoin mining conference in Australia I got this feedback from the CEO of a Bitcoin mining company, not for the first time. Other tactics I employed In sport, offensive strength draws the adulation of the crowd, but defence often wins the game, especially at the highest level. For this reason, I decided to find and rebut FUD articles, sometimes on a daily basis. I believe this has made it increasingly uncomfortable for journalists to write misinformation about Bitcoin and energy. I’ve called out Bitcoin misinformation repeat-offenders, but only ever criticising their work, never them as people (mindset matters). 80% of these journalists are no longer writing about Bitcoin and energy at all. When a new journalist writes some nonsense, I make sure that on every social media platform possible their errors are called out, with supporting evidence. I also spoke to journalists as they started to show cautious interest in the emerging truth. My intention was to arm many Bitcoiners with as many well quantified facts as possible. Knowing that we lacked the resources, the reach and the megphone of mainstream media and GreenpeaceUSA’s $5M of funding, we had one thing going for us: truth. But truth is not enough, we had to win by being more sharp and more clear with the conveyance of this truth. Consistent, repeatable, quantified messages started to pay off as other Bitcoiners recycled these messages and used them to overwhelm misinformation with facts. You can do this too. Many of you already are. We’ve made outstanding progress on changing the Bitcoin & Energy narrative as we can see from this chart. source: Bitcoin Perceptions However, there is still a plethora of “it’s a ponzi”, “no inherent value”, “not scaleable” misinformation that persists. If you take these same principals and tactics I’ve applied to Bitcoin & energy FUD and apply them to countering other types of Bitcoin misinformation, we will start to see Bitcoin misinformation atrophy across the board. 3. Avoid blindfolded archer syndrome Today, someone messaged me, excited that they had secured a meeting with the CEO of an energy company to discuss Bitcoin mining, and asking me for advice on how to orangepill him. Here’s how I responded. We can apply this numerous ways. For example, when someone approaches me and says “I’m thinking about getting into Bitcoin, but I want to know a bit more. Can we chat?” my answer is generally “Sure. There’s a lot I could say, so I want to make sure I do not overwhelm you. Tell me what’s important to you?” I might follow up with a couple more questions first to understand the person’s values. How? Let’s not overcomplicate this: I ask “Tell me a bit about your values.” What I will say to a liberal, environmentally minded person who values social justice is very different from what I’ll highlight to an economics student trained in Keynesian economics. Both replies will be true, but only one will be relevant to each person. It’s also worth digging into the nuances. I would follow up the former person by asking “what forms of social justice do you care about most in the world?” Again, “Children working on open dumps in Cambodia” means a different response to “reducing income inequality in my home city”. And yes, Bitcoin can help both communities. The big idea is this: most of the successful strategies we can use to influence other people are not some complex super-move, they come down to consistent execution of the basics. Asking, framed well, is often the most important conversation you can have. Get used to discussing what they need to hear, not what you like to say. 4. Questions > statements If someone quotes energy consumption and/or emission numbers at you that are out of date, pause and respond “Yes I am aware of those numbers. <Pause>. Are you aware that those are old numbers and that Bitcoin’s energy consumption figures and emission numbers have now been revised down?” If someone says “Bitcoin uses too much energy”, do not say “But have you looked at other industries? Bitcoin’s energy is just a rounding error (what Michael Saylor said). Instead say “You are right. Bitcoin mining uses a huge amount of energy. Are you aware that most environmentalists say that we need more of the right type of energy consumption at least in the short term to achieve net zero emissions? <pause> And it turns out Bitcoin is the right type of energy we need more of, for five reasons. Would you like me to take you through them?” Alternatively you could say. “Yes, Bitcoin uses a huge amount of energy. Are you aware that prominent environmentalists such as Saul Griffiths in his book Electrify have argued that a base condition for the renewable transition occurring is that we need more energy demand? <pause> And did you know that the type of energy demand most needed is flexible demand, which is exactly what bitcoin mining provides?” Did you know that bitcoin mining is the only industry in the world that mitigates 7% of its entire emissions without offsets? If someone says “Well, even if it’s using more sustainable energy and creating fewer emissions, that only proves that it’s less bad for the environment.” Say “You are right. The fact that it generates fewer emissions does not in itself mean it’s good for the environment. <pause> Equally, we’ve only looked at negative environmental externalities so far. Do you think as a principle that when evaluating any new technology we should consider both its drawbacks and its potential benefits, or do you think we should only look at its drawbacks? They will respond words to the effect “Well of course we should look at both?” or “Well of course both, but there are no positive benefits” in which case you could simply ask “How do you know?” Whatever they respond, you could continue, did you know that out of the last 11 peer reviewed papers on Bitcoin and energy, 10 of them discovered environmental benefits? Not theoretical benefits, but actual measurable benefits that are helping decarbonization goals today? Alternatively you could say “Are you aware of the benefits of bitcoin?” then “Would you like to know? then “Did you know that there are 21 environmental benefits from bitcoin?” If someone quotes the Whitehouse’s 2022 report on cryptomining, don’t reply “That’s propoganda, put out as part of Operation Chokepoint 2.0” (while probably true, its also likely to be dismissed as your non-evidence based opinion by the person you’re speaking to. Similarly, if someone quotes some mainstream media article who has reference an Alex de Vries article, don’t say “He’s a central bank employee who’s got a vested interest in attacking Bitcoin.” Instead, respond by asking “Yes they did say that. <pause>. Do you know who was the major source used for that report?” And you know that the models he used have now been debunked on 4 separate occasions in academic journals? Don’t quote them, it’ll make you look like your intention is to be right, not to help the other person close a knowledge-gap, but for your reference they are (Masanet et al. 2019, Dittmar et al. 2019, Sedlmeir et al. 2020 Sai & Vranken 2023) Case Study: orange-pilling a pension fund Firstly, I would recommend that you find someone highly knowledgeable about dealing with pension funds, to accompany you. Once you’ve done that, be curious and ask a lot of questions about what they are seeking to achieve on behalf of their investors into the fund. Don’t presuppose Bitcoin is right for them. It might not be. State this, so they can see you are there to educate not evalgenize. One of the key questions is the time horizon. At some point you pass the whole fund over to the insurer. How long does the fund have to run? If it is one year or less, that’s too short a timeframe for Bitcoin to be the right solution for them given its volatility. But if it’s closer to ten years, it would be risky not to hold Bitcoin. Model different percentage allocations to Bitcoin including 3% allocation and see how it met their overall fund objectives. What this will show is that in the Worst case (Bitcoin goes to zero), it will take an extra 3 months to reach their investment return objectives over a 10 year period. But in the best case it will take 8 years, rather than 10 years. So it will either go Really well or a bit bad. Remind them that you’re helping them shortcut their learning curve, because a private individual will take longer. They will make mistakes, buy NFTs and alt coins and trade them and Bitcoin using leverage, get rekt, and then return to what they were told to do in the first place: Hold and don’t sell. Part of what gives them comfort is that others are doing it, so let them know which peers are doing it. Show them how increasingly for institutional investors including Blackrock, this is considered part of normal portfolio allocation “In five years it will be normal. So very exciting to be at the front of this” Because they care about risk, show them how it is risky not to hold Bitcoin, because, if money premium comes out of other assets which the pension fund is holding (real estate and equities) they are essentially unhedged in the event that Bitcoin moons. This means that not only do they miss out on Bitcoin, but they see the value of their other assets reduce, because the investment into Bitcoin will directly come out of other asset classes they hold (black hole theory). Therefore having 0 bitcoin is the riskiest position, and the question becomes not “should you hold Bitcoin” but “how much bitcoin do you have.” One of the biggest challenges is “how do you custody?” Show them how the ability to hold an asset outside the current financial system and without counterparty risk is therefore diversification of risk that may happen in the world in the next 10 years (war, unwinding of US dollar dominance, rising fear of US debt levels, money printing). If they want to allocate to Bitcoin through an ETF, point out “Given that this is one of the few bearer assets that you can hold, why would you not want to reduce your counterparty risk by doing it?” If you are thinking, “Daniel knows a lot about pension funds, I don’t have the domain knowledge to even know where to start” – not so. Yes I know a reasonable amount about sovereign wealth funds, a little more about family offices, and a more again about impact investment and ESG funds. But I know perhaps 45 minutes more than you about pension funds, because I spent 45 minutes listening to the right podcast, which was by Jordan Walker, interviewing Sam Roberts, director of Cartwright, who orange-pilled UK’s first Pension Fund. 5. Highest probability of deepest impact Once I asked my coach what means of communication I should use, when I was seeking to change the mind and heart of someone in the technology industry. His reply has stayed with me to this day “What form of communication has the highest probability of the deepest impact?” It was clear that I had to talk to this person, not email him. Often we use the weakest medium of communication when seeking to influence someone, public online exchange. Why do we do this? Because it is convenient. I’ve fallen into this trap of convenience myself, despite the fact I know better. Asking the question “what has the highest probability of the deepest impact” makes doing what’s comfortable and convenient, uncomfortable. Private text message is more powerful than public online exchange. Spoken one-on-one is more powerful than text one-on-one. One-to-many is more powerful than one-to-one (generally). That’s one of the reasons I speak at a lot of events. There are upwards of several hundred people, in an undistracted setting, who for 20 minutes get to hear me speak on a topic I’ve been working hard to present as effectively as I can, after some person has introduced me as having expertise in the domain I’m talking about. Not only is this more efficient, it creates a vibe in the room that is hard to create one-on-one. That vibe, that energy, is part of what influences people. Recently, someone messaged me who had used this approach himself. He reflected on exactly the same phenomenon. 6. Framing is everything My coach also once told me “There is no conversation you cannot have, as long as you frame it right.” This one truth caused me to lean into many courageous conversations I otherwise would have avoided. It’s why I had multiple conversations with Josh Archer, who at the time was head of GreenpeaceUSA’s Change the Code campaign. It helped me to stay in rapport with him while pointing out numerous factual errors in the campaign. It’s why I felt able to suggest they drop the campaign. Josh ended up leaving the campaign shortly after our second meeting, and GreenpeaceUSA suspended the entire campaign (from what I can see) on 14 June 2024. The framing I now use when talking about the ESG merits of Bitcoin to skeptics is to show them the non-obvious truth: that New technology negativity bias is a rite of passage On a recent podcast, I joked “It took me two months to work out that Bitcoin was net positive for the environment, two years to work out how to explain that to others. This was somewhat true. While I’d had some successes orange-pilling people, it wasn’t happening at the speed or the volume I knew was possible. I saw others having the same struggles. When I asked those who had given talks to groups of non-Bitcoins about Bitcoin and ESG for example, the typical answer was “It went well. People were open to what we had to say, and we’ve opened up a good dialog. It will take time to change minds, but the work has started on a good footing.” Let’s be clear: this is a very bad outcome. Of course, while you have an hour of people’s time, you can expect a temporary softening of their position. However, history tells us that if the response is this lukewarm, there is a high likelihood they will quickly revert to their original position once surrounded by their tribe, their old information sources. Coming back to intention, what if we set a bolder intention? What if we set the intention that skeptics were not just “more open” at the end of our talk, but had fundamentally and permanently flipped their position? Why should this be an unreasonable goal to have? In my book “on pitching”One Pitch“, I write about the importance of setting a bold intention, giving the example of when in my third capital raise for my first technology company, I had the intention not only to gain investment but to inspire the audience, and how this intention caused me to do deliver my pitch in a way that was well outside my comfort zone. At the end of the talk, the most frequently occurring piece of feedback was “inspiring”. So when I was invited to pitch Bitcoin to a group consisting of the principals of Family Offices in EU recently, I set this intention in mind that they would flip completely and permanently by the end of the meeting. The brief I was given was a typical brief I hear from institutional investors and Impact Funds, “They all want to invest in Bitcoin. They all believe they can’t because of the ESG story.” I decided that I had to use a new approach. There had been so much misinformation about Bitcoin and energy, that tackling it point by point would take too long. I know, I’ve tried, here. My document is informative, but it is not persuasive. It serves only as a follow-on to answer specific objections, once someone already believes that Bitcoin is net positive for the environment, but it cannot flip their belief-system. A new approach was called for. So I went back to an intuition I had way back in 2022 which I hadn’t explored because I knew it would take a lot of time and research. I went back to researching the history of how all disruptive technologies are appraised by experts and the media during the first 10-20 years of their emergence. This approach proved to be the game-changer. You can see the framing at the start of this keynote I gave in Frankfurt and Amsterdam. Now, rather than combat media misinformation from the media article by article, I had a truth-hammer that could show why even someone who generally had high trust in mainstream media should disregard everything the media had ever written about Bitcoin & Energy. You can tell how well a pitch has gone from the quality of the questions afterwards. “So, what was the point about Bitcoin being able to obviate gas peaker plants, sorry I don’t know much about grids so I didn’t quite get that, could you explain” is a very bad question to get. It says you haven’t succeeded in explaining ideas in language that laypeople can understand, let alone influence them of their value. “How do we know that it was Bitcoin that was responsible for Texas not needing gas peaker plants?” is a better question, but still bad, because it means you did not show the evidence why it is certain that Bitcoin mining was the reason for this pivot in strategy from the grid operator. “You make the point about gas peaker plants, but I’m wondering “Can this work on every grid, or is it only a solution for Texas’ grid?” is better again, but still bad, because it means you failed to say “this is not just a solution for Texas, but every grid in the world. In fact, here’s how Bitcoin mining could obviate the need for gas peaker plants worldwide.” “It sounds so good. Are there any problems with Bitcoin mining”, “So what’s the best way to invest?”, and “Can you tell us more about Microstrategy’s corporate playbook?” are the right type of question, because it means they have fully accepted your information as fact, modified their belief system completely on the basis of the new information, and are now looking to build upon this understanding by taking actions that align with their new world-view. When I heard those questions, I knew that finally after two years I had found the way to orange-pill people, particularly ESG-skeptics, in a way that had the highest probability of the deepest impact. Happily, its also proven reproducable, with two people writing back that they have used this specific framing to excellent effect. As we speak, the originator of the message above is talking to the ministers of a mid-large sized nation-state about a Bitcoin strategic reserve, and nation-state bitcoin mining to stabilize their grid / monetize stranded renewable energy. We’ve also heard that one of the Family Office principals who sits on the board of a major airline is now proposing to her board why they should adopt MSTR’s Bitcoin treasury strategy. 7. Apply feedback and iterations, calmly Orange-pilling is not something you are either good at or not. It is like playing tennis. You get better at it if you play the game more. You get better faster if you not only play the game, but review your performance. So review your own game footage, whether that’s a talk, a podcast, or a zoom session. If you’re not sure it’ll be recorded, ask. If you’re not sure how to ask, frame it. For example, you could say “I’m wanting to make sure that each time I explain Bitcoin to people I improve, so would it be OK if I record this, for my own learning?” When reviewing, I ask myself two very simple questions What went well (things I can re-use, that I otherwise might have not re-used) What would I do differently next time? When I look back on how I used to explain the benefits of bitcoin, to how I do it now, I’ve improved a lot over the last two years, and that is in part due to going through my game footage with these two questions in mind. All of this could fail however, if you don’t remain in a calm state-of-mind while doing this and applying the other points above. You’ve proabably notice that the people whose voices you trust are capable of discussing ideas while maintaining respect for the other person’s position. This is easy to say, but hard to do! It’s particularly hard to do when it’s a subject you care about passionately. Toxic maximalism may help existing bitcoin Hodlers to keep the faith during a bearmarket, or help others steer clear of an altcoin scam, but it’s not the vibe that will enamor the early majority to Bitcoin. The single best way to keep the state of mind necessary to remain objective, respectful and focused is meditation. It’s the one thing that has enabled me to remain resilient when my own work and motives have been questioned in some pretty ad ad hominem way, and its as legitimate a tool of your orangepilling toolkit as any in this post.

      "content": "A detailed guide\n----------------\n\n![](https://batcoinz.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Screen-Shot-2024-11-21-at-3.52.14-PM-1024x533.png)\n\nI believe that the most important action that Bitcoiners can take, which is not currently being taken with enough focus/skill, is to improve the way we communicate the value of Bitcoin to the next wave of Bitcoin adopters. These people are the “early majority”. They care about different things to the early adopters. If we fail to do this, Bitcoin adoption will be top heavy insofar as Corporates and Nation States start building their Bitcoin reserve, but the everyday people are left behind, not seeing the value-alignment of Bitcoin with their own value-set. There’s also a risk that even institutional adoption will be slow across many nations, where the values of the investment fund are in apparent but not actual conflict with Bitcoin.\n\nThis paper lays out my first attempt at a remedy to address this.\n\nIntroduction\n------------\n\nWhat are the blockers that could stop us moving from the early adopters into the early majority of Bitcoin adopters? There are many factors, and the answer often depends on the audience. For example, for pension funds the blockers have been “the fact that none of my peers are doing it” and ESG. For the general population, it’s often “I don’t know where to start”, or “It’s not straightforward to get Bitcoin in the first place, and how do I get it to and from my bank?” For liberals it is almost always, “It’s bad for the environment and/or it does nothing useful”.\n\nToday I’m going to take a step back and look at an element of adoption that is critically important, yet not widely understood: how we pitch Bitcoin to a community of people.\n\nYes, what we say, and having the charts, data, information and education is important. But even more important is knowing how to present this information to skeptics.\n\nMy intention is that this document serves as a resource for others to help you orangepill more regulators, policymakers, boards, fund managers and, most importantly, retail investors to adopt Bitcoin, or at least adopt a friendly stance towards Bitcoin.\n\n### Why this; why now?\n\nThis document open sources a lot of the strategies that I’ve used to orangepill skeptics to Bitcoin. While this post focuses mostly on the environmental and humanitarian benefits to Bitcoin, the principles can be applied to any Bitcoin topic where you’re seeking to orangepill someone. When I look at the disparity between how the early adopters were convinced to embrace Bitcoin, and how the early majority need to be spoken to in order to come to Bitcoin, I see a danger that we will ostracize many potential future advocates through sloppy attempts at orangepilling that are not just ineffective but in many cases counter-productive. I believe that ending orangepilling naivety will be critical as ending regulatory hostility when it comes to the next wave of Bitcoin adoption.\n\nWhile some have said that I have changed the narrative on Bitcoin and energy, I am most definitely not the only person who has shifted the narrative, nor am I the most important person. There is at least one person who has objectively done more than me to orangepill key globally recognized figures on the ESG merits of Bitcoin (in many cases ESG was the blocker for them embracing Bitcoin). This person wishes to remain anonymous. In this post, I cite numerous examples of where people have gotten a positive outcome through adopted my orange-pilling techniques. My intention in sharing this is not to glorify anything I have done, but to evidence the effectiveness of certain ways of communicating that over time, and through the help of some great mentors, I have found to be effective.\n\nWhile in a tech-centric industry such as Bitcoin, it is easy to think this is because of the [BEEST data model](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1YSsIk2ghvPDHTcfUKkKo9cqg0XI_gSGh/edit?gid=2041929466#gid=2041929466) of sustainable energy usage and other [long form research](https://batcoinz.com/quantifying-the-potential-impact-of-bitcoin-mining-on-global-methane-emissions-4/) I conducted, I would say that the data model was 30% of what mattered, but the other 70% was how I put together messages differently using other people’s research. This is something that can be learnt and replicated using many of the seven principals of effective orangepilling described below.\n\nFinally, to those who wonder “Isn’t there a chance that by open-sourcing these strategies, these can be weaponized against Bitcoin?” No. Because everything I describe here only works if you have truth and fact on your side, have domain knowledge in the area you are speaking, and are communicating as an act of service to others without agenda or attachment. Why am I qualified to write about this? Results are the only qualification. But in case you are interested, it’s an area I did some work in before in my pre-Bitcoin days. Orangepilling is a truncated way of saying “successfully pitching Bitcoin” and pitching is something a little bit about having [written a book on it](https://www.amazon.com.au/dp/0473392135?ref_=mr_referred_us_au_nz). Before that, I coached tech entrepreneurs in pitching. Before that, I also led a [technology company](https://www.geneious.com/) through three cap raises, where  \nI had to learn a lot about pitching in a hurry! Those pre-Bitcoin experiences gave me a sense of what needed to be done between 2022-2023 to start to change the mainstream narrative around Bitcoin & Energy. This post looks at lessons we can all pull from what worked, when it comes to orangepilling the next wave of Bitcoin adopters.\n\n### Your lived experience makes you uniquely qualified to talk to your tribe\n\nI first became aware of this watching Michael Saylor talk about the energy consumption of Bitcoin during a quarterly [Bitcoin Mining Council update](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYoHCs_jDcM). Michael Saylor is one of Bitcoin’s most gifted communicators. He inspires me to improve my own communication. He is inspiring, lucid, visionary, yet at the same time able to back up his statements with solid data and examples. I will never forget the brilliant way he cut across a podcaster who suggested that it was risky being “all in on Bitcoin”, with the question “Are you all in on the chair you’re sitting on?”\n\nSo it was with intrigue that on the question of why Bitcoin is a strong ESG asset, he was the least compelling I’d seen him. The reason was simple: the environment is “not his thing”. He is absolutely the right person to convince billionaires, millionaires, boards of corporations, and a large number of early adopters to get into Bitcoin. He is not the right person to convince the early majority of liberal retail investors, ESG investment committees at Sovereign Funds and Pension Funds why Bitcoin is a great ESG asset. This is true for the simple reason that this isn’t who he is. Each of us have a community of people we will vibe with, who we understand deeply. This gives us a special and unique responsibility to orange-pill this community of people. It is quite probable that there are certain people who can only come to understand and use Bitcoin through you.\n\nThat said, there are some universal principles we can apply that will make us more effective at orange-pilling people who are adjacent to our community, even if they are not exactly “our tribe”.\n\nSeven principles of effective orange-pilling\n--------------------------------------------\n\n### 1\\. Meet people where they are\n\n![](https://batcoinz.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Screen-Shot-2024-11-21-at-3.47.15-PM-1024x513.png)\n\n  \nThis sounds simple, so simple that it is often skipped over. Yet it is 50% of how influence occurs.\n\nLet’s look at a real example. How do you feel as a Bitcoin supporter when you read this tweet?\n\n![](https://batcoinz.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Screen-Shot-2024-11-20-at-11.26.13-AM-1024x176.png)\n\nMy bet it is is some combination of frustrated, exasperated or bored and irate.\n\nYes, the comment is ignorant. Yes, the comment is also arguably arrogant, because the writer has assumed that s/he knows Bitcoin’s utility without having investigated bitcoin’s utility. It is also flawed, because the [vast majority of contemporary research](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/danielsbatten_from-mining-to-mitigation-how-bitcoin-can-activity-7255865336925716480-SxQx?utm_source=share&utm_medium=member_desktop) on Bitcoin mining shows that Bitcoin is an important part of climate action. However, neither the emotions you feel, nor the facts you know have any relevance to the other person, if your intention is to help them look at other perspectives.\n\nWhat it comes down to is the question “what do I want?” If what you want is a chance to offload and give this person a piece of your mind, then you will respond the way that most people do on Twitter, get a quick endorphin hit of saying your piece. But what did you achieve? Very little. If anything, all you’ve done is help calcify a belief in the other party that Bitcoiners are obnoxious.\n\nBut what if your intention was different. What if your intention was to plant a seed that blows the person’s mind, that speaks to their latent intellectual curiosity. What if your intention was to invite dialog, or even to invite them in a non-confronting way to help them see the gaps in their knowledge? Then you’d choose a different response.\n\nI optimize for “what response is most likely to orange-pill them?” There is no spin, no manipulation at play. My intention is to help the person learn, but only if they are curious. If they are not, then I respect that too. For that reason, I also test whether they are open to learning, and if not to politely move on. That’s more efficient with my time, it avoids squandering my emotional energy, and it’s more respectful of the other person.\n\nHow I responded on that occasion was like this.\n\n![](https://batcoinz.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/S",

      "title": "How Activist NGOs Have Unintentionally STALLED Progress TOWARDS Ending Gas Flaring",
      "summary": "The World Bank set an ambitious goal: eliminate nearly all gas flaring by 2030. Flaring, the burning of excess natural gas during oil extraction, is a major environmental problem, releasing millions of tons of CO2e (CO2 equivalents) in the form of methane and other toxic pollutants into the atmosphere annually. The problem is, flaring only burns 91.1% of the methane, so the other 8.9% goes unburnt directly into the atmosphere. This contributes to climate change significantly because methane is 84 times more warming over a 20 year period than CO2. In regions like the Middle East, flaring has been shown to cause more harm than previously thought, with recent studies revealing higher levels of toxic gases like benzene and sulfur dioxide (source: World Bank Global Gas Flaring Tracker, 2023). Despite the urgency, progress to end flaring has been slow. While there are many factors at play, but one of the most significant barrier is also the most overlooked: environmental NGOs themselves, specifically a small handful of the more ideologically-driven activist environmental NGOs. These organizations, while well-intentioned, have consistently criticized and undermined almost all efforts from outside commercial organizations to collaborate with oil and gas companies to reduce flaring. In this article, we’ll examine how this tendency to label such initiatives as “greenwashing,” their failure to offer viable alternatives, and their creation of an environment of fear have disincentivized other industries from partnering with oil companies to address this critical issue. The result? Flaring continues unabated and the environment, that these NGOs exist to be faithful stewards to, suffers. False positives: The harmful side-effect of calling something “greenwash” that’s not One counter-productive tendency of these NGOs has been their eagerness to label any and all collaboration with oil and gas companies as “greenwashing.” This term, which refers to superficial or misleading environmental claims, has become a catch-all critique for any effort to reduce flaring. These environmental NGO critiques are often reactive rather than analytical. For instance, when General Electric (GE) and Baker Hughes developed technologies to capture and utilize stranded gas, environmental groups like Sierra Club and Greenpeace accused them of “enabling continued fossil fuel extraction” without acknowledging the tangible emissions reductions these technologies achieved (source: Sierra Club Statement, 2020; Greenpeace International, 2020). By focusing on ideological purity rather than measurable outcomes, these NGOs have created a chilling effect, discouraging companies from pursuing innovative solutions to flaring. Incredibly, these criticisms have continued even when direct, measurable, and significant reduction of methane emissions has been the result. For example, when Crusoe Energy, a Bitcoin mining company, partnered with oil producers to convert flared gas into electricity, Jesse Simons, Deputy Director of Sierra Club’s Beyond Dirty Fuels Campaign, dismissed the initiative as “propping up the fossil fuel industry” (source: Sierra Club Press Release, 2022). Similarly, John Noël, Senior Climate Campaigner at Greenpeace USA, criticized ExxonMobil’s pilot project with Crusoe in the Permian Basin, calling it a “distraction from the urgent need to phase out fossil fuels entirely” (source: Greenpeace USA Statement, 2021). Criticism Without Solutions Another issue is the tendency of these NGOs to criticize without offering alternatives. For example, when BP partnered with Climeworks, a carbon capture company, to explore using captured methane for industrial purposes, and when Shell worked with Enerflex, a gas processing company to reduce flaring at their oilfields, Carroll Muffett, President of the Center for International Environmental Law (CIEL), accused both companies of using flaring reduction as a “public relations tool” (source: CIEL Press Release, 2021). Similarly, Friends of the Earth criticized waste-to-energy startup Ener-Core for “perpetuating the fossil fuel economy” without proposing a practical alternative for addressing stranded gas (source: Friends of the Earth Report, 2019). While it is an absolutely legitimate function of an environmental NGO to help the public understand when genuine greenwash is at play, the universal tendency across NGOs to label all collaborations with oil companies to end flaring as “greenwash” suggests strongly that there is neither analysis nor discrimination at play here on the part of these environmental NGOs, rather guilty verdict by virtue of the fact one would deign to partner with an oil company. Well, if outside organizations cannot partner with oil companies to deal with methane emissions, oil companies will continue with their own solution: flaring. The environment deserves better service than that. This pattern of criticism without constructive solutions is not only unhelpful but counterproductive. Flaring is a complex problem that requires immediate action. The International Energy Agency (IEA) estimates that oil will still account for 22% of global energy demand in 2050, even in a net-zero scenario (source: IEA Net Zero by 2050 Report, 2021). Given this reality, the choice is not between oil production and no oil production—it is between flaring/venting and utilizing the gas in a way that reduces emissions. By dismissing efforts to address flaring without offering viable alternatives, these NGOs have effectively pushed the industry toward the most environmentally harmful option: continued flaring. How an Environment of Fear Disincentivizes Collaboration Perhaps the most counterproductive consequence of these NGOs’ actions is the environment of fear they have created. Companies that might otherwise partner with oil and gas producers to reduce flaring are often deterred by the risk of reputational damage. For example, renewable energy developers like NextEra Energy and Ørsted have considered using stranded gas for power generation but faced backlash from groups like 350.org and Oil Change International. These organizations accused NextEra of “betraying its renewable energy mission” and Ørsted of “legitimizing the fossil fuel industry” (source: 350.org Press Release, 2021; Oil Change International Report, 2021). This environment of fear has stifled innovation and collaboration. Waste-to-energy startups, renewable energy developers, and even technology giants like GE and Baker Hughes have been reluctant to engage with oil and gas companies, fearing the wrath of activist NGOs. The result is a missed opportunity to reduce emissions and accelerate the transition to a cleaner energy future. Bitcoin Mining: A Pragmatic Exception In this context, Bitcoin mining has emerged as a rare exception. Companies like Crusoe Energy and Upstream Data have been willing to partner with oil producers to convert flared gas into electricity, reducing emissions and generating economic value. These initiatives have been praised by the World Economic Forum for their tangible impact on flaring reduction, even as they face criticism from some NGOs. Crusoe’s projects in North Dakota and Wyoming have reduced flaring by over 90% at partnered sites (source: Crusoe Energy Case Studies, 2023). Similarly, Upstream Data’s operations in Canada have prevented millions of tons of CO2-equivalent emissions annually (source: Upstream Data Reports, 2022). Bitcoin mining’s success in addressing flaring highlights the importance of focusing on outcomes over ideology. NGOs like Sierra Club and Greenpeace were highly criticized of these partnerships at their inception, but have not acknowledged the measurable emissions reductions they ended up achieving. Analysis before ideology For us to have any hope of working collaboratively to end flaring, it’s critical for enviromental NGOs to step up and stop crying “greenwash” without analysis, as has been their tendency, to the detriment of the environment and collaborative action. The fight against flaring is too important to be derailed by ideological purity, and there is a phrase in the environmental movement that they would do well to remember “the perfect is the enemy of the good”. While the intentions of activist NGOs are good, good intentions divorsed from nuanced thinking can and has been counterproductive to the very environmental progress they only exist to create. Their reactive criticism, lack of viable alternatives, and creation of an environment of fear have hindered progress on this critical issue. To truly address flaring, we need a new approach—one that prioritizes measurable outcomes and encourages collaboration. These critiques, while well-intentioned, are misguided. By discouraging collaboration with oil companies, these NGOs inadvertently push the industry to deal with methane emissions in the most environmentally harmful way: flaring or venting. Continued inaction is simply not an option. It’s time for environmental organizations to stop criticicing every imperfect effort to move forward, and get their own house in order. In practical terms, this means: Properly evaluating whether collaborations are greenwash, or whether they can make a measurable difference Learning to work alongside commercial operations to better understand their motivations and strategies before simply criticizing them Taking time to do their own research, including engaging with experts in the domain (something that has been conspicuous by its absent in NGOs criticisms of Bitcoin mining and other industries) Take responsibility for the fact that they have the power to aid environmental progress, but equally the power to hinder progress through criticizing they may not fully understand and which may in fact be a solution, or part of the solution. Free themselves from the trap of overzealously declaring “greenwashing” even when it’s a false positive, and focus on what really matters: working collaboratively to reduce emissions and protecting the environment.",

      "title": "How Ideologically-Driven Environmental NGOs Have Hindered the Phase-Out of Gas Peaker Plants",
      "summary": "Gas peaker plants, which fire up during periods of high electricity demand, are a critical yet environmentally damaging component of many energy grids. These plants emit significant amounts of CO2, nitrogen oxides (NOx), and particulate matter, disproportionately impacting low-income communities near their locations. While there is broad consensus on the need to phase them out, progress has stalled. Surprisingly, a key barrier comes from an unexpected source: ideologically driven environmental NGOs. Despite advocating for cleaner energy, these groups have often opposed pragmatic solutions to reduce peaker plant reliance. By dismissing collaborations with utilities and energy companies as “greenwashing” outright, and refusing to engage with transitional technologies, they inadvertently prolong the lifespan of these polluting facilities. The Problem with “All or Nothing” Activism Many environmental NGOs operate under a rigid ideological framework that rejects any solution involving fossil fuel infrastructure, even if it demonstrably reduces emissions in the short term. This stance has led to the dismissal of viable bridge technologies, such as: Retrofitting Peaker Plants with Carbon Capture or Efficiency Upgrades In 2021, Duke Energy proposed retrofitting gas peaker plants in North Carolina with carbon capture systems and hybrid natural gas-battery systems to cut emissions by 50%. However, the Sierra Club and Sunrise Movement labeled the plan a “false climate solution,” arguing it legitimized fossil fuels. The project was shelved, leaving older, higher-emitting peakers in operation (source: Duke Energy Sustainability Report, 2022). Renewable-Natural Gas Hybrid Projects In California, where peaker plants contribute to poor air quality, startups like Mote Hydrogen sought to convert peakers to run on hydrogen-blended natural gas. While this would reduce NOx emissions by 30%, NGOs like 350.org criticized the effort as a “distraction from true renewables,” despite the lack of large-scale battery storage to replace peakers entirely (source: California Air Resources Board, 2023). These examples highlight a pattern: NGOs frequently attack projects that could meaningfully reduce emissions while offering no scalable alternatives. The result? Utilities default to maintaining outdated peaker plants rather than risk reputational damage from NGO backlash. Criticism Without Grid-Scale Alternatives The International Energy Agency (IEA) estimates that even in net-zero scenarios, natural gas will supply 15% of global electricity by 2040 due to grid stability needs (source: IEA World Energy Outlook, 2022). Transitioning away from peaker plants requires bridging solutions, yet NGOs often reject these outright. For instance, when NextEra Energy proposed replacing Florida peaker plants with solar farms paired with gas turbines (to ensure reliability during cloudy periods), the Center for Biological Diversity accused the utility of “greenwashing fossil fuel dependence.” No alternative plan was put forward, leaving aging peakers operational (source: Tampa Bay Times, 2021). Similarly, in New York, the closure of the Astoria peaker plant was delayed after local NGOs opposed a replacement facility using lower-emission turbines, demanding immediate 100% renewables—a goal the grid couldn’t yet support (source: NYISO Reliability Report, 2022). This absolutism ignores grid realities. Battery storage remains costly and limited in duration, leaving peaker plants as a necessary backstop. By blocking incremental improvements, NGOs ensure dirtier status-quo operations persist. Bitcoin Mining: A Pragmatic Alternative to Gas Peaker Plants in Texas While gas peaker plants have long been the default solution for grid stability during peak demand, Bitcoin mining has emerged as a scalable, cost-effective, and environmentally superior alternative—particularly in Texas. By acting as a flexible demand-side resource, Bitcoin mining has already demonstrated its ability to reduce reliance on peaker plants, even as ideologically driven NGOs and fossil fuel interests continue to oppose it. How Bitcoin Mining Replaces Gas Peaker Plants Gas peaker plants are designed to activate only during periods of extreme electricity demand, typically running fewer than 1,500 hours annually. However, their high costs, methane emissions, and environmental harms make them a poor long-term solution. Bitcoin mining, by contrast, provides grid operators with a unique tool: the ability to rapidly curtail energy consumption during peak demand, stabilizing the grid without the need for additional fossil fuel infrastructure. In Texas, this approach was pioneered by ERCOT CEO Brad Jones following the catastrophic 2021 Winter Storm Uri, which exposed the fragility of relying solely on peaker plants. Jones recognized that Bitcoin miners—unlike traditional industrial loads—could shut down operations within seconds, freeing up gigawatts of power for critical needs during emergencies. This flexibility allowed ERCOT to: Avoid building 3 GW of new gas peaker plants proposed by Berkshire Hathaway Energy, saving Texans an estimated $18 billion in infrastructure costs. Integrate more renewables by providing a “buyer of last resort” for excess solar and wind energy, which incentivizes renewable development. Reduce emissions by displacing peaker plants, which emit 0.4–0.6 tons of CO2 per MWh and leak methane even while idling. Peer-reviewed studies validate this strategy. Bruno et al. (2023) found that Bitcoin mining with demand response eliminated the need for gas peaker plants entirely while reducing annual carbon emissions by 48.67 million metric tons compared to baseline scenarios (Table 1). Rhodes et al. (2024) further concluded that Bitcoin mining’s flexibility enables grids to prioritize renewable energy over fossil fuels, accelerating decarbonization. Texas: A Proof of Concept By 2024, Bitcoin mining operations in Texas had grown to 3 GW of flexible load capacity, participating actively in ERCOT’s demand response programs. This resource proved critical during extreme weather events, such as the July 2023 heatwave, when miners voluntarily powered down to free up 1.2 GW of electricity—equivalent to the output of three large peaker plants. ERCOT has since reported zero blackouts despite record demand, crediting Bitcoin mining as a key factor in grid resilience. Dr Rian Dewhurst, of the Digital Assets Research Institute explains “Bitcoin mining doesn’t just stabilize the grid—it helps build a cleaner one. Grid operators no longer need expensive, polluting peaker plants idling on standby.” Opposition from Fossil Fuel Interests Despite its proven benefits, Bitcoin mining faces fierce opposition from entities invested in gas peaker plants. Berkshire Hathaway Energy, which lobbied aggressively for $18 billion in peaker plant contracts, has funded lobbying efforts to discredit Bitcoin mining through proxies like Lt. Gov. Dan Patrick. Patrick has repeatedly claimed Bitcoin “destabilizes grids,” a narrative debunked by ERCOT and academic research. This backlash underscores Bitcoin mining’s disruptive potential. As Dewhurst noted, “When you have 3 GW of flexible load, the business case for peaker plants evaporates.” Texas’ experience demonstrates that Bitcoin mining is not merely a theoretical alternative to gas peaker plants—it is a proven, scalable solution. By prioritizing grid needs over ideology, ERCOT has shown how collaboration with Bitcoin miners can phase out peaker plants while saving costs, cutting emissions, and accelerating the renewable transition. Toward Pragmatism: A Call for NGO Accountability The climate crisis demands urgency, but dogmatism and poor research stifles progress. To phase out peaker plants, NGOs must: Evaluate Collaborations Objectively Assess whether partnerships with utilities or energy firms yield measurable emissions reductions rather than reflexively crying “greenwash.” Engage with Grid Realities Acknowledge the role of transitional technologies until renewables and storage scale sufficiently. Prioritize Outcomes Over Ideology Recognize that the perfect is the enemy of the good — hybrid systems are better than perpetuating outdated peakers, and Bitcoin mining based solutions are better again, because they can accelerate the phasing out of gas peaker plants without any gas-powered backed to compensate for variable renewable energy intermittency. The perfect cannot be the enemy of the good. By clinging to purity tests, NGOs risk becoming unwitting allies of the very fossil fuel systems they seek to dismantle. It’s time to embrace pragmatism—before another decade of peaker plants locks in avoidable emissions.",
      "content": "Gas peaker plants, which fire up during periods of high electricity demand, are a critical yet environmentally damaging component of many energy grids. These plants emit significant amounts of CO2, nitrogen oxides (NOx), and particulate matter, disproportionately impacting low-income communities near their locations.

      "title": "The Role of Bitcoin Mining in Climate ACTION",
      "summary": "Overview As a climatetech investor, I consider our top four climate issues that technology can help us resolve to be: 1. Remove bottlenecks to getting more renewable energy onto the Grid Accelerating the green energy transition means we must overcome these four sub-challenges: reduce interconnection queues reduce wasted solar and wind energy and cut curtailment fees reduce the 8.1 year payback period for solar and wind generation facilities raise flexible energy generation demand 2. Replace Fossil fuel based heat with electrically based heat 3. Increase the speed and profitability of R&D into new renewable energy projects 4. Urgently end three carbon-intensive practices: Use of Gas Peaker Plants, methane venting and methane flaring This paper will examine, using existing case studies and research, how Bitcoin mining could be an important catalysts for climate action in each of these four categories. Background: why the narrative on Bitcoin and the environment changed? From 2018-2022, most of the narrative on Bitcoin mining focused on negative environmental impacts. These commentaries focused on issues such as excessive emissions, water use and e-waste “per transaction”. This narrative started to shift in late 2022, and by 2024 had been replaced with a narrative that focused mainly on positive environmental externalities. There was no single factor that caused this shift. The changes were due to a combination of Better data. Earlier data relied heavily on the work of Alex de Vries. In 2023 however Sai and Vranken found significant flaws in his methodologies concerning how he measured eWaste, water consumption, energy consumption and emissions. Cambridge recently reinforced this, finding that de Vries’ eWaste estimation was overestimated by more than 1000%. Other studies such as Lei et al found fundamental flaws in his use of Bitcoin resource consumption “per transaction” (Bitcoin does not in fact consume energy or water per transaction). The greening of the Bitcoin mining network itself. In 2018-2021, Bitcoin mining did indeed use a higher fossil fuel consumption than other sectors such as the banking sector. However more recent studies show that Bitcoin mining now uses predominantly sustainably sourced power As the research community has better understood the nascent technology, more nuanced and complete studies on Bitcoin mining in academic circles has emerged. 14 of the last 16 papers on Bitcoin and energy now support the thesis that numerous positive environmental impacts arise from Bitcoin mining. Media outlets then shifted their reporting to reflect the new data. Today, the majority of sustainability magazines who cover Bitcoin mining highlight its benefits, while 85.7% of mainstream news coverage on Bitcoin mining and energy since 2023 has also been positive. This shift is covered at length in our earlier piece “Is Bitcoin good or bad for the environment?” which we would recommend that readers who are unfamiliar with the changing view in the academic community and among energy commentators read first. To date, despite the improved studies on Bitcoin mining, they have tended to appear only in academic journals which may be inaccessible to the general public or those not familiar with the idiosyncracies of how grid infrastructure or methane mitigation works. Specifically, there not yet been an evidence-based article that attempts to objectively synthesize the different ways Bitcoin supports, or could in the future support, climate action. This article makes a first humble attempt to do so, using a combination of peer reviewed research sources, case studies and Whitepapers, to come up with an overall perspective on how Bitcoin is, and could in the future, promote Climate Action. 1. Remove bottlenecks to getting more renewable energy onto the Grid Why resolving these four challenges is critical Interconnection Queues Lengthy interconnection queues delay renewable projects from connecting to the grid. Reasons for delay include old transmission infrastructure, regulatory bottlenecks, limited grid capacity, lack of financing for the renewable project, and concern from the grid operator about the impact on the grid of more intermittent power sources. These delays can be as long as 10-15 years, slowing the renewable transition, and compromising our net zero emission goals. Wasted Renewable Energy and Curtailment Intermittent renewable generation often exceeds grid demand, forcing renewable operators to curtail excess energy. Curtailment can have far-reaching consequences, impacting not only the financial viability of renewable projects but also grid stability. It also hurts economically, with added costs often being handed on to consumers, because the grid operator must often pay the renewable generator a fee for not being able to take their energy. Australia for example is currently wasting 25% of all renewable energy. Such waste not only hurts economically, it slows down the renewable transition both directly and indirectly: directly by reducing the profitability and therefore the expansion-speed of renewable operators, and indirectly by giving fuel to opponents of renewable energy to question the viability of the renewable transition itself. Create more demand-side flexibility Variable Renewable Energy such as solar and wind generation require electrical grids to balance variable supply with adaptable demand. Lack of flexible demand (industries that can adjust usage) or demand response programs results in grid instability, making it harder to justify expanding renewables without risking grid reliability. Flexible consumers provide grid operators with the confidence to be able to increase the amount of variable renewable energy generation on a grid, knowing they have a demand-side shock-absorber in place. Long Payback Periods for Solar/Wind Facilities High upfront costs and slow returns (often 8–10+ years) limit cash flow for reinvestment. Extended payback periods deter investors and slow the scaling of renewable projects, delaying the transition from fossil fuels. How Bitcoin mining alleviates each renewable grid transition challenges By acting as a flexible, location-agnostic energy buyer, Bitcoin mining can reduce bottlenecks in renewable energy deployment, cut waste, and incentivize the construction of new renewable energy infrastructure. Let’s explore how Bitcoin mining achieves this through four key mechanisms: reducing interconnection queues, minimizing wasted energy, raising flexible energy demand, and shortening the payback period for renewable energy projects. 1.1 Reduce Renewable Energy Interconnection Queues One of the biggest challenges in deploying renewable energy is the lengthy interconnection queue process. In the U.S. alone, there are over 2,000 gigawatts (GW) of renewable energy projects waiting to be connected to the grid, according to the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory. These projects often face delays of several years due to regulatory hurdles, grid capacity constraints, and the need for costly infrastructure upgrades. Bitcoin mining can help alleviate this bottleneck by providing a flexible customer for renewable energy projects. Unlike other electricity consumers, miners can set up operations near renewable energy sites, bypassing the need for grid interconnection altogether. This allows energy producers to start generating revenue immediately, rather than waiting years for approval. For example, in West Texas, Bitcoin miners have partnered with wind farms to monetize excess energy that would otherwise be stranded due to grid constraints. In Ethiopia, the Electric Power Agency has welcomed Bitcoin miners to buy excess energy from the Grand Ethiopian Renaissance Dam (GERD), in turn, powering growth and green energy and earning the country $55M in 10 months, which they are using to build out additional transmission capacity to deliver more renewable energy The scientific community agrees: by reducing the financial and logistical barriers to renewable energy deployment, Bitcoin mining accelerates the adoption of clean energy, a finding that is supported by You et al, 2023 (Mining to Mitigation: How Bitcoin Can Support Renewable Energy Development and Climate Action) and Menati et al, 2023 (High resolution modeling and analysis of cryptocurrency mining’s impact on power grids) 1.2 Reduce Wasted Solar and Wind Energy Waste and Cut Curtailment Fees Renewable energy sources like solar and wind are inherently intermittent, meaning they generate energy only when the sun shines or the wind blows. This intermittency often leads to overproduction during peak generation periods, forcing grid operators to curtail (waste) excess energy. In 2020, California curtailed over 1.5 million megawatt-hours (MWh) of solar and wind energy—enough to power 150,000 homes for a year. This wasted energy represents lost revenue for renewable energy producers and undermines the economic viability of clean energy projects. In Texas, there have been many cases of underutilized solar or wind farms. For example In 2022 Compute North (Now US Bitcoin Corp) purchased a 280 wind farm in West Texas. The farm had been known for high curtailment fees rates when wind was produced that could not be utilized by the grid due to weak demand. By providing a guaranteed customer for that surplus wind energy, the Bitcoin facility reduced waste, ended curtailment fees, and helped stabilize the grid. Also on the ERCOT grid, when Bitcoin mining company Jiachi West began operating in Texas, they reported that renewable energy curtailment dropped by 4%, and renewable energy profitability increased by 12%. By monetizing curtailed energy, Bitcoin mining not only reduces waste but also improves the financial sustainability of renewable energy projects. 1.3 Slash the Payback Period for Solar and Wind Generation Facilities The high upfront costs of renewable energy projects often result in long payback periods, discouraging investment. According to a recent peer-reviewed study, the average payback period for solar and wind facilities is 8.1 years. However, Bitcoin mining can reduce this payback period to 3.5 years by providing a reliable and lucrative revenue stream for energy producers. But these are not just academic theoretical possibilities. Indeed academia has lagged behind a large volume of real-world projects that have already integrated Bitcoin mining with renewable energy in order to increase the payback time. For example, Deutsche Telecom, Germany’s largest telco has begun using Bitcoin mining to monetize its otherwise wasted wind and solar power. It hopes to use the increased revenue to make solar and wind production more profitable, and reinvest the profits into more renewable generation. Tepco, Japan’s largest Utility company also recently announced a project to begin using Bitcoin mining on its wasted renewable energy. It’s goal is to further reduce waste of renewable electricity by using Bitcoin mining’s time-of-day agnostic properties to use solar/wind that otherwise would have been curtailed. 1.4 Create More Demand Side Flexibility Saul Griffiths, a leading energy expert and author of Electrify: An Optimist’s Playbook for Our Clean Energy Future, argues that flexible energy demand is essential for incentivizing the construction of new renewable energy infrastructure. Unlike traditional industries, which require a constant and predictable energy supply, Bitcoin mining is highly flexible. Miners can scale their operations up or down in response to energy availability, making them ideal partners for renewable energy producers. This flexibility creates a symbiotic relationship between Bitcoin miners and renewable energy developers. For example, during periods of low energy demand (e.g., sunny afternoons or windy nights), miners can ramp up operations, providing a steady revenue stream for energy producers. Conversely, during peak demand periods, miners can power down, freeing up energy for the grid. This dynamic helps stabilize the grid and encourages the development of more renewable energy capacity. In places like Norway, where hydropower dominates the energy mix, Bitcoin miners have become key players in balancing supply and demand, ensuring that renewable energy remains profitable and scalable. By improving the economics of renewable energy projects, Bitcoin mining helps unlock the capital needed to build more solar, wind, and hydropower facilities. These real-world examples highlight how Bitcoin mining is not just a consumer of energy but a strategic partner in the global transition to a sustainable energy future. Brad Jones, former CEO of ERCOT Texas’ grid, used Bitcoin mining to stabilize the grid after winter storm Uri, saying that Bitcoin mining ‘Helps us get more renewables onto the grid” but also “helps us counterbalance the intermittency of renewables” 1.5 Summary Bitcoin mining accelerates the green energy transition by helping both grid operators and renewable generators to overcome four challenges reduce interconnection queues reduce wasted solar and wind energy and cut curtailment fees reduce the 8.1-year payback period for solar and wind generation facilities raise flexible energy generation demand While it is by no means the only technology required to solve the first two challenges, there is equally strong evidence that it is the most profitable way to reduce both solar/wind payback periods and increase the flexibility of energy consumption. Additionally, it should be noted that sustainably-powered Bitcoin mining companies are not an anomaly, but rather they are an increasing norm. Currently there are 70 sustainably powered Bitcoin mining companies. 41 of these companies use 98%+ zero-emission power sources, and a further 29 using carbon-negative sources. Collectively these mining companies have helped make Bitcoin the world’s most sustainably powered global industry (52.4% as of April 2025). Like eVs, Bitcoin is a fully electrified technology with no direct emissions. Also like eVs, Bitcoin produces secondary emissions because a portion of the power used comes from fossil fuel sources. Also like eVs it is important to remember that this power obviates a more emission-intensive predecessor: petrol and diesel transport in the case of eVs; banking services and the extractive and fossil-fuel dependent gold industry in the case of Bitcoin. 2. Replace Fossil fuel based heat with electrically based Heat Why it matters According to the IEA, 50% of all the world’s energy is used for heating. Most of that heat is fossil fuel based. In parallel to greening the grid, prominent environmental campaigners and energy experts such as Saul Griffiths in his book Electrify state that we must also electrify as many industrial processes as possible, with heating being the single largest candidate for rapid electrification. While Bitcoin mining cannot replace the intense heat of a coal furnace, there are significant amounts of other heat forms that the exhaust heat of Bitcoin miners can replace and is now replacing. The potential uses for heat from Bitcoin mining are significant and growing. Some of these are one-off applications, whereas others such as delivering district heating to 2% of Finland’s population are already operating at a significant scale. The first reported example of a commercial operation using heat recycling from Bitcoin mining was Heatmine which started using Bitcoin heat for home heating in Canada in 2018. Since then, the use of heat recycling from Bitcoin mining has rapidly expanded. Since then, the applications of heat recycling have grown significantly. Cambridge University for example recently reported that “by redirecting this heat for applications such as district heating, greenhouse cultivation, or pool heating,miners can transform a byproduct into a resource. Meanwhile the International District Energy Association in their Q3, 2025 report stated “Electrifying heat production, especially in regions with low-carbon or renewable electricity, offers one of the most direct and effective ways to reduce emissions from district heating. Using the heat generated from bitcoin mining could significantly advance this electrification, transforming digital energy infrastructure into a source of high-temperature, low-carbon heat.” source 2.1 Evidence that heat-recycling is now occuring at scale District heating and water heating: MARA is now warming a town of ~80,000 residents in Finland using heat generated from Bitcoin mining operations. This is possible through district heating which involves centrally heating water using Bitcoin mining-generated heat and distributing it through underground pipes to local buildings. Heating public swimming pools: Global News recently covered how Bitcoin mining recycled electrical heat could be used to heat a public swimming pool, while earning money for the community Residential space heating: Home heating has grown from a fledgling industry in 2021 to a competitive market in 2025 with multiple vendors offering options to heat homes using electric heaters that mine Bitcoin in parallel, including 21energy, Heatbit and D-Central. Drying Lumber requires huge amounts of energy at a constant rate, but not so high as to “cook” the wood, making it a perfect candidate for Bitcoin mining exhaust heating. This started at scale in Norway, and is now being investigated in other countries. Heating for Horticulture: Bitcoin Brabant, led by Bert de Groot, has been helping decarbonize the greenhouse industry in the Netherlands by using solar-powered Bitcoin mining to deliver heat for the greenhouses. This reduces the greenhouse industry’s reliance on natural gas. There are already many such greenhouses being heated by Bitcoin mining, and this use has the potential to scale to help industrial greenhouses wean themselves off the need for natural-gas based heating. Replacing gas heating of greenhouses is a common use of Bitcoin exhaust heat. Bitcoin Brabant is now scaling this up, using solar powered Bitcoin mining Fish farming: Meanwhile, in Germany, there’s the Green Bitcoin Farm which harvests solar energy and uses it to operate high-performance computers in the Bitcoin network. They then use the waste heat generated by the ASIC miners for drying medicinal herbs, indoor rearing of edible fish, and vertical farming. Using Bitcoin recycled heat to heat the water for fish farms is also a common use in China. 2.2 One-off applications with the potential to scale In 2023, Shelter Point Distillery in Campbell River, Canada, created the ‘world’s first sustainable digital tumbler‘ by attaching a Bitcoin miner to provide heat for the whiskey aging process. Genesis Digital Assets (GDA) launched a Bitcoin mining heat repurposing project in Norsjö, Sweden, using renewable hydro-energy. The recycled heat is used to reduce the costs of preventing snow-cleaning trucks from freezing in an area prone to harsh winters. Constellation Heating uses its Star Heater to repurpose heat to maintain pool temperatures, replacing more emission intensive techniques such as gas heating. A car and truck wash in Idaho replaced its fossil-fuel based gas heating system with a Bitcoin mining heating system, using a Fog Hashing B6 immersion tank and Bitcoin ASIC miners to generate heat. When this New York Bath House started using Bitcoin heat to heat its water, it drew attention to how common the practice of using Bitcoin mining to heat water is now becoming. 3. Lift speed and profitability of R&D into new renewable energy projects 3.1 OTEC Bitcoin mining has been responsible for reviving mothballed renewable energy technologies such as OTEC, that the Reagan administration stopped funding in the 1980s. Unlike Solar and Wind technologies which are intermittent, OTEC (Ocean Thermal Energy Technology) is able to deliver reliable baseload electricity. OTEC however suffered from a lack of funding, because it is very expensive to develop novel offshore energy generation capacity in the tropics which is grid-tethererd. In addition to the challenge that offshore wind faces in supplying power back to the grid, OTEC must also develop hurricane resistance. Nate Harmon: Hawaiian Oceanographer, Clean Energy Pioneer and CEO of OceanBit, which uses Bitcoin mining to catalyze OTEC R&D Bitcoin mining on sea barges removes these constraints by providing a consumer of OTEC energy in situ. This means that the next scale-up R&D effort for OTEC is suddenly economically viable, because the operation will not need the considerable cost of being grid-tethered and made hurricane-proof. While eventually the aim of OTEC is that it will deliver power back to the grid, Bitcoin mining is playing a critical role in catalyzing the economic viability of the scale-up phase of R&D that prior to Bitcoin mining had been mothballed since the 1980s. OceanBit, which is developing OTEC (Ocean Thermal Energy Technology) was recently profiled in Forbes Magazine. OTEC was mothballed in the 1980s for political rather than technological reasons. OceanBit aims to produce abundant baseload renewable energy. Bitcoin mining is according to CEO Nate Harnon what enabled them to dust the mothballs off OTEC and start working on making OTEC economically viable. 3.2 Renewable Microgrids Gridless Compute, a Nairobi-based startup, is tackling one of Africa’s most persistent challenges: bringing reliable, renewable energy to remote communities. Traditional microgrid projects often fail due to high upfront costs and lack of consistent demand. Gridless Compute’s innovation? Pairing solar and hydropower microgrids with Bitcoin mining to create a guaranteed, flexible energy buyer. Image Source: CNBC In this presentation, Erik Hersman, the founder of Gridless showcases how broken the energy model in Africa is, resulting in 600 Million African living without electricity, and demonstrated how Bitcoin mining is already starting to unlock untapped renewable energy resources to solve this issue. Gridless says it’s sites have already powered 8,000 homes that were without electricity: 1,200 houses in Zambia, 1,800 in Malawi and 5,000 in Kenya. Academic studies have long argued that demand flexibility is key to microgrid viability. Gridless proves this by using Bitcoin mining as a “digital battery,” monetizing surplus energy that would otherwise go unused. As CEO Erik Hersman notes, “Bitcoin mining turns stranded energy into economic lifelines.” With plans to deploy 20 microgrids across sub-Saharan Africa by 2025, Gridless is demonstrating how Bitcoin can democratize energy access while accelerating decarbonization. 3.3 Other climatetech endeavors As humans adapt to Climate Change, the challenge of getting enough drinking water to arid countries becomes an increasing challenge. There is no one solution to this challenge, but part of the solution is to improve the cost-effectiveness of desalination, which is very energy intensive. MARA, who have also pioneered Landfill Gas powered Bitcoin mining, home heating, flare-gas mitigation and wind-powered Bitcoin mining, has begun investing in improving desalination technology while concurrently using Bitcoin mining heat, rather than natural gas, to desalinate water. This results in more water desalination per dollar of energy spent. This innovation if scaled, has the potential to increase water abundance in arid countries. 4. End carbon-intensive environmental practices (Gas Peaker Plant utilization, methane venting and methane flaring) 4.1 Gas Peaker Plants Gas peaker plants, notorious for high emissions and idle-time inefficiencies, are being obviated in Texas thanks to Bitcoin mining’s demand flexibility. Following Winter Storm Uri in 2021, ERCOT CEO Brad Jones integrated Bitcoin miners into grid stability programs. By 2024, 3 GW of mining capacity participated in demand response. In a recent report from the Digital Assets Research Institute (DARI,) the data shows that Bitcoin mining has now become a critical part of Texas’ ability to scale up the concentration of renewable energy on the electrical grid to meet the needs of their population growth. The ability for Bitcoin miners to curtail usage at peak times was sown to have saved Texas taxpayers $18 Billion because ERCOT did not need to purchase highly polluting peaker plants. During extreme weather, miners power down within seconds, freeing electricity for critical needs. For instance, during the July 2023 heatwave, Texas miners curtailed 1.2 GW (equivalent to three peaker plants’ output). Peer-reviewed studies by Bruno et al. (2023) support Bitcoin mining’s ability to eliminate grid reliance on peaker plants. ERCOT’s success demonstrates that flexible load resources like Bitcoin mining are not just alternatives to peaker plants—they are superior, more cost-effective replacements that support a greater concentration of renewable energy on the grid. 4.2 Turning Landfill Methane into a Climate Asset Landfills account for 17% of global methane emissions, a gas 84x more potent than CO2. Traditional solutions, like flaring or building gas pipelines, are often impractical because very few commercial operations can co-locate next to a landfill, or prohibitively expensive due to the cost required to upgrade the grid to handle additional electricity upload. Bitcoin mining offers a breakthrough: mobile mining units can convert vented methane into electricity on-site, eliminating emissions and generating revenue. In 2023, Vespene launched its 1.6 MW landfill gas-powered Bitcoin mining operation in Marathon County, one of five Bitcoin mining companies to do so. The project will mitigate 20,000 tonnes of CO2e per year. A new study was released in 2024 demonstrating that using landfill gas (LFG) for Bitcoin mining is economically viable, sustainable, and environmentally beneficial. Meanwhile, NodalPower now conduct landfill gas powered Bitcoin mining on two separate sites. Bitcoin mining companies like NodalPower and Vespene Energy deploy modular data centers at landfills, using methane to power miners. Over the duration of a project, Municipalities earn millions in power which can be reinvested into community programs, while saving millions in flare maintenance costs. Meanwhile, the methane becomes a climate asset rather than a liability. There are currently five Bitcoin mining operations operating on landfills, who are turning trash into digital gold. It would only take 35 mid-sized venting landfills with Bitcoin-mining power-generation operations on them to take the entire Bitcoin network carbon-negative. 4.3 Ending Oilfield Flaring Gas flaring, which wastes energy while emitting the climate super-warmer methane, persists globally despite World Bank efforts to stop almost all flaring by 2030. To date we have found few ways to make good that intention, with flaring in regions including the Middle East having recently been shown to cause more toxic gases than previously feared. Bitcoin mining is increasingly recognized in independent reports to be a potential scalable solution to this problem. Cambridge’s April 2025 Bitcoin Mining Report for example called Bitcoin mining a “Potential Solution to Gas Flaring” that shows the “potential for innovation to simultaneously address environmental challenges”, estimating that Bitcoin mining was mitigating 2.2 MT of CO2e emissions per year. In North Dakota for example, Crusoe’s projects reduced flaring by 99% at partnered sites. Similarly, Upstream Data’s Canadian operations have been cutting flaring since 2017. In another example, climate tech company Unblock Global has achieved 15MW of flare gas powered bitcoin mining in Argentina. The company has a mission to eliminate flaring in Latin America and raised $15 million to use flared gas from Argentina’s Vaca Muerta, to power its operations. These are three of the 29 Bitcoin mining companies that have found a way to solve the 160-year old problem of wasted flare gas. It is for this reason that the World Economic Forum recently praised Crusoe’s Bitcoin mining operation for helping the UN in its efforts to reduce methane emissions. Yet NGOs like Sierra Club continue to reflexively dismiss measurable progress such as this as “greenwashing”, saying that any company partnering with Oil&Gas to reduce flaring is “perpetuating the profits of oil companies.” As our earlier article on Gas Flaring highlights, this argument is not only flawed, but it has arguably led to the elongation of the practice of gas flaring. Without Bitcoin mining, the alternative is continued flaring. However, by monetizing waste gas, Bitcoin mining uniquely aligns economic incentives with environmental progress. 4.4 Summary: How Bitcoin Mining helps cut methane emissions and end environmentally harmful gas dependencies These Bitcoin mining projects are neither one-offs, not small. There are 29 Bitcoin mining companies who are carbon negative that we know of (using methane emissions as their fuel source), and 3 GW of gas peaker plants (that we know of) that have been obviated as a direct result of Bitcoin mining. The combined impact of carbon-negative Bitcoin mining is that mitigation has already reached 7% of the Bitcoin network’s emissions. As mentioned above, according to the Digital Assets Research Institute, and another 35 mid-sized venting landfills is all it will take for the entire Bitcoin network to become carbon negative. Remarkable, Bitcoin mining has in the last three years demonstrated an ability to profitably and scaleably tackle all three of these thorny environmental challenges where other technologies have proven either unprofitable, unscalable or both. Remarkable, Bitcoin mining has in the last three years demonstrated an ability to profitably and scaleably tackle all three of these thorny environmental challenges where other technologies have proven either unprofitable, unscalable or both. 5. Preserving nature Monetizing wasted renewable energy not only accelerates the energy transition but also helps save nature. For example, in East Congo, lies Virunga National Park, a 7,800 Km2 terrain that’s home to half of Africa’s terrestrial species. During COVID the park was threatened with closure, having lost most of its income, and having no way to pay its staff that protected the park from poachers, and militias who cut down trees to use as charcoal for fuel due to energy shortages in the region. Park Director Emanuel de Mode stated that Virunga “would have gone bust as a national park if not for Bitcoin mining.” The jobs created through the Bitcoin mining operation also provide an alternative income for the militias currently burning down rainforest to sell charcoal. Also, within Virunga National Park lies a chocolate factory that the exhaust heat from Bitcoin mining is providing the drying for, reducing costs and helping to pay those who work there a living wage. This is not a one-off example. In Costa Rica, Bitcoin mining prevented the loss of a 60Ha of land which had been in Eduardo Kopper’s family for 5 generations, and financed its transformation into an eco-sanctuary. The model used was identical to Virunga: utilize the otherwise stranded and wasted surplus hydropower to do Bitcoin mining onsite, and reinvest that into saving the land. Critics often assume, without research, “they could have done something else with that stranded energy”. Such a view is not only naive, it also diminishes the environmental contributions of stewards of the land such as de Mode in Virunga Kenya, and Kopper in Poaz Costa Rica, neither of whom were Bitcoiners, and both who spent years researching what to do with that stranded energy before realizing that Bitcoin mining was their one available option due to its unique location-agnostic, time-of-day agnostic features. 6. The unintended consequence of uninformed criticism While in some cases Bitcoin mining companies have looked for opportunities that enhance nature, it is equally true that sometimes they have neglected it. Before late-2021, a lot of Bitcoin mining was coal-based, A Bitcoin mining operation stole considerable electricity from the grid, while another in Niagara Falls was fined for being being an excessively noisy neighbor. There have been other instances of such noise complaints also. Critics and journalists should expose genuine bad actors. When it comes to this reporting, three glaring problems stand out. Firstly, for every genuinely bad actor, there have been misreported reports of bad actors that weren’t. For example, Greenidge Generation was misreported both as opening a gas plant for Bitcoin mining, which caused toxic algal blooms in an adjacent lake (it didn’t, it opened to provide power back to the grid, and there was no elevated lake temperature). Other reports have falsely accused Bitcoin mining companies of raising Texas electricity prices, destabilizing the grid and using excessive water. These claims all turned out to be not only baseless or based on very poor data, but contradicted by studies which reveal Bitcoin mining in fact has stabilized the grid (see claim 21) and helped lower electricity prices (see claim 22) by reducing curtailment fees while raising grid operator revenues. An anti-Bitcoin reporting bias only antagonizes those in the Bitcoin mining industry towards reporters, and deflects the attention that should be given to genuinely bad actors. The second issue is that those reporting on one off examples where Bitcoin mining operations are alleged to have negatively impacted a community have tended to also take a subjective side-swipe at the entire industry. Time Magazine did this in their Feb 2024 coverage of a Bitcoin mining company’s noise levels. More recently, the Cooldown used this same recipe by adding to an otherwise accurate piece of reporting on the Thai Bitcoin operation a wholly inaccurate statement “Whether done legally or illegally, the environmental impact of cryptocurrency mining cannot be understated.” The comment is an example of a side-swipe that ignores the scientific consensus. In this instance, the article cited a comprehensively debunked outlier study on Bitcoin mining to back up the statement. Again, such statements antagonize the industry against the reporting organization, rather than keeping the focus on what may be a genuine issue worthy of examination. But the third issue is the most severe, because it doesn’t just hurt Bitcoin mining but the wider climate movement. Criticism, particularly from Environmental NGOs, without understanding of Bitcoin’s ability to end gas peaker plant reliance and substantially reduce flaring has directly contributed to the elongation of both the need for gas peaker plants, and the practice of natural gas flaring. (See linked studies for evidence of how NGO criticism of Bitcoin mining has backfired for the Climate movement). 7. The Carbon Payback Time of Climatetech It should not be trivialized that Bitcoin mining currently emits 46 Mt CO2-eq of emissions annually according to the Digital Assets Research Institute (up from the already significant 41 MT CO2e in 2021). The habit of some in the Bitcoin ecosystem of saying “But other industries omit much more” has earned the ire of some in the environmental movement and rightly so; every industry must take steps to reduce its environmental footprint. Equally, context matters: the photovoltaic (PV) industry, despite its critical role in decarbonizing energy systems, did not achieve a net-positive carbon balance until 2011—57 years after the first solar cell was invented in 1954. PV manufacturing continues to this day to rely on energy-intensive processes and coal furnaces to melt silicon during the manufacture process, however it is widely accepted that the photovoliatic industry is net emission producing, because it now reduces many times more emissions than it creates. All climatetech, including solar, has a carbon debt in the initial phase. Yet few recognize this when evaluating a nascent technology’s net environmental impact Similarly, Bitcoin’s emissions must be considered alongside its proven role in cutting methane (84x more potent than CO2), scaling renewables and other factors mentioned in this article. More importantly, like EVs, those emissions are not “additional”. By using the Bitcoin network, one is utilizing a fully electrified technology in preference to two substantially more emission intensive industries, The Banking system (as a method of transacting), and the Gold mining (as a store of value). The combination of much more careful research by critics and less trivializing of the real current-day emissions of Bitcoin mining will go a long way to ensuring Bitcoin mining realizes its full potential as a key tool of climate action. A balanced evaluation of Bitcoin mining, as with any emerging climate technology, requires assessing both its current footprint and its future potential. Just as early solar investments paved the way for today’s carbon-negative PV industry, Bitcoin mining’s ability to fund renewable infrastructure, eliminate methane emissions, and stabilize grids may ultimately yield net reductions far exceeding its operational emissions. Policymakers and environmental stakeholders must adopt this balanced lens, looking not only at current emissions but future potential. A good rule of thumb is this: if our rubric for evaluating a nascent technology’s climate impact would have resulted in solar panels being banned in the 1990s (when the photovoltaic industry created considerably more emissions than it abated), then it is likely to be a bad methodology. Conclusion: Bitcoin Mining is Tier 1 Climate Action Bitcoin mining has emerged as a linchpin for addressing four systemic barriers to climate progress, as demonstrated by both real-world data and case studies. First, Bitcoin mining directly tackles renewable energy bottlenecks. It does this by monetizing stranded power, miners reduced interconnection queues in Texas and Ethiopia, enabling wind farms like US Bitcoin Corp’s 280 MW Texas project, while cutting curtailment fees. Jaichi West for example found that just a 4% reduction of curtailment led to a 12% increase in profitability. Solar and wind payback periods, once 8.1 years, now fall to 3.5 years when paired with mining, which has led Germany’s largest Telco, Deutsche Telekom and Japan’s largest Utility, Tepco, to start utilizing Bitcoin mining for their previously wasted renewable energy. Second, Bitcoin mining replaces fossil-based heat at scale. MARA’s district heating system now warms 80,000 residents in Finland. Collectively, Bitcoin mining in Finland supplies district heat to 2% of the country’s population. Similar projects, from drying lumber in Norway to decarbonizing Dutch greenhouses (Bitcoin Brabant), prove that waste heat can displace gas-dependent processes. Third, Bitcoin mining accelerates R&D for neglected climatetech. OceanBit revived OTEC, a previously mothballed baseload renewable energy source, by using Bitcoin mining as a catalyst to bypass otherwise prohibitive R&D costs. Gridless Compute’s Kenya-based microgrids, powered by biomass and hydro paired with mining, electrified 8,000 homes across Africa and aim to deploy 20 grids by the end of 2025. Fourth, Bitcoin mining curtails methane emissions with measurable impact. Bitcoin mining collectively mitigates 3.2 million tons of CO2e annually, while Texas’ ERCOT saved taxpayers $18 billion by using 3 GW of mining demand flexibility to avoid building new fossil-fuel intensive gas peaker plants. Critics who dismiss these efforts as “greenwashing” overlook not only the sheer volume and scale at which Bitcoin mining is now measurably enabling climate action across multiple areas, but also the hard data: 61.5% of Bitcoin mining now uses >98% sustainable energy, and carbon-negative mining (29 companies) already offsets 7% of the network’s emissions. Projects like Virunga National Park—which credits Bitcoin mining for saving its 7,800 km² rainforest and funding anti-poaching and deforestation efforts—show that Bitcoin mining’s value extends beyond energy systems to biodiversity preservation. To policymakers and NGOs: the evidence is clear. Bitcoin mining is no longer a hypothetical solution—it is already resolving the grid instability issues at scale that accompany higher concentrations of solar/wind energy, electrifying parts of rural Africa, and funding OTEC breakthroughs. Rejecting Bitcoin mining’s contribution to climate action risks prolonging reliance on gas peakers, methane flaring, and methane venting. In the race to net-zero, Bitcoin mining is not optional—it’s operational. Let’s embrace it, research it, and leverage its unique ability to solve some of the toughest roadblocks en route to our Net Zero Emission goals. Footnote: Bitcoin achieves these climate outcomes while providing a number of equally numerous humanitarian benefits at an increasing scale. But that is a subject for another article.",

These commentaries focused on issues such as excessive emissions, water use and e-waste “per transaction”. This narrative started to shift in late 2022, and by 2024 had been replaced with a narrative that focused mainly on positive environmental externalities.\n\nThere was no single factor that caused this shift. The changes were due to a combination of\n\n1.  Better data. Earlier data relied heavily on the work of Alex de Vries. In 2023 however [Sai and Vranken](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2096720923000441) found significant flaws in his methodologies concerning how he measured eWaste, water consumption, energy consumption and emissions. Cambridge recently reinforced this, finding that de Vries’ eWaste estimation was overestimated by more than 1000%. Other studies such as Lei et al found fundamental flaws in his use of Bitcoin resource consumption “per transaction” (Bitcoin does not in fact consume energy or water per transaction).\n2.  The [greening](https://forkast.news/bitcoin-minings-green-mile-54-5-sustainable-energy-use/) of the Bitcoin mining network itself. In 2018-2021, Bitcoin mining did indeed use a higher fossil fuel consumption than other sectors such as the banking sector. However more recent studies show that Bitcoin mining now uses predominantly sustainably sourced power\n3.  As the research community has better understood the nascent technology, more nuanced and complete studies on Bitcoin mining in academic circles has emerged. [14 of the last 16 papers](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/danielsbatten_from-mining-to-mitigation-how-bitcoin-can-activity-7280429495679963136-2E-q?utm_source=share&utm_medium=member_desktop) on Bitcoin and energy now support the thesis that numerous positive environmental impacts arise from Bitcoin mining. Media outlets then shifted their reporting to reflect the new data. Today, the majority of [sustainability magazines](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/danielsbatten_bitcoin-miner-mara-buying-114-mw-wind-farm-activity-7280432749180559360-AaWO/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=member_desktop) who cover Bitcoin mining highlight its benefits, while 85.7% of [mainstream news coverage](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/danielsbatten_why-bitcoin-is-key-to-the-future-of-finance-activity-7278907968035700737-9IwO/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=member_desktop) on Bitcoin mining and energy since 2023 has also been positive.\n\nThis shift is covered at length in our earlier piece “[Is Bitcoin good or bad for the environment?](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/bitcoin-good-bad-environment-im-confused-daniel-batten-racec/?trackingId=wax2F0yrRQ2xupf%2BsSl9bA%3D%3D)” which we would recommend that readers who are unfamiliar with the changing view in the academic community and among energy commentators read first.\n\nTo date, despite the improved studies on Bitcoin mining, they have tended to appear only in academic journals which may be inaccessible to the general public or those not familiar with the idiosyncracies of how grid infrastructure or methane mitigation works. Specifically, there not yet been an evidence-based article that attempts to objectively synthesize the different ways Bitcoin supports, or could in the future support, climate action. This article makes a first humble attempt to do so, using a combination of peer reviewed research sources, case studies and [Whitepapers](https://www.da-ri.org/science-hub), to come up with an overall perspective on how Bitcoin is, and could in the future, promote Climate Action.\n\n![](https://batcoinz.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/image-5-1024x576.png)\n\n1\\. Remove bottlenecks to getting more renewable energy onto the Grid\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n### Why resolving these four challenges is critical\n\n**Interconnection Queues** Lengthy interconnection queues delay renewable projects from connecting to the grid. Reasons for delay include old transmission infrastructure, regulatory bottlenecks, limited grid capacity, lack of financing for the renewable project, and concern from the grid operator about the impact on the grid of more intermittent power sources. These delays can be [as long as 10-15 years](https://ratedpower.com/blog/UK-interconnection-delays/), slowing the renewable transition, and compromising our net zero emission goals.\n\n**Wasted Renewable Energy and Curtailment** Intermittent renewable generation often exceeds grid demand, forcing renewable operators to curtail excess energy. Curtailment can have [far-reaching consequences](https://www.pfnexus.com/blog/what-is-curtailment), impacting not only the financial viability of renewable projects but also grid stability. It also hurts economically, with added costs often [being handed on to consumers](https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-024-02497-0), because the grid operator must often [pay the renewable generator a fee](https://www.parallelparliament.co.uk/lord/lord-ashcombe2/bill/2024-26/greatbritishenergy) for not being able to take their energy. Australia for example is currently [wasting 25%](https://www.abc.net.au/news/2024-09-08/renewable-energy-wasted-as-australia-greens/104321770) of all renewable energy. Such waste not only hurts economically, it slows down the renewable transition both directly and indirectly: directly by reducing the profitability and therefore the expansion-speed of renewable operators, and indirectly by giving fuel to [opponents of renewable energy](https://www.britannica.com/procon/alternative-energy-debate) to question the viability of the renewable transition itself.\n\n**Create more demand-side flexibility** Variable Renewable Energy such as solar and wind generation require electrical grids to balance variable supply with adaptable demand. Lack of flexible demand (industries that can adjust usage) or demand response programs results in grid instability, making it harder to justify expanding renewables without risking grid reliability. Flexible consumers provide grid operators with the confidence to be able to increase the amount of variable renewable energy generation on a grid, knowing they have a demand-side shock-absorber in place.\n\n**Long Payback Periods for Solar/Wind Facilities** High upfront costs and slow returns (often 8–10+ years) limit cash flow for reinvestment. Extended payback periods deter investors and slow the scaling of renewable projects, delaying the transition from fossil fuels.\n\n#### How Bitcoin mining alleviates each renewable grid transition challenges\n\nBy acting as a flexible, location-agnostic energy buyer, Bitcoin mining can reduce bottlenecks in renewable energy deployment, cut waste, and incentivize the construction of new renewable energy infrastructure.\n\nLet’s explore how Bitcoin mining achieves this through four key mechanisms: reducing interconnection queues, minimizing wasted energy, raising flexible energy demand, and shortening the payback period for renewable energy projects.\n\n### 1.1 Reduce Renewable Energy Interconnection Queues\n\nOne of the biggest challenges in deploying renewable energy is the lengthy interconnection queue process. In the U.S. alone, there are over 2,000 gigawatts (GW) of renewable energy projects waiting to be connected to the grid, according to the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory. These projects often face delays of several years due to regulatory hurdles, grid capacity constraints, and the need for costly infrastructure upgrades.\n\nBitcoin mining can help alleviate this bottleneck by providing a flexible customer for renewable energy projects. Unlike other electricity consumers, miners can set up operations near renewable energy sites, bypassing the need for grid interconnection altogether. This allows energy producers to start generating revenue immediately, rather than waiting years for approval. For example, in West Texas, Bitcoin miners have partnered with wind farms to monetize excess energy that would otherwise be stranded due to grid constraints.\n\nIn Ethiopia, the Electric Power Agency has welcomed Bitcoin miners to buy excess energy from the Grand Ethiopian Renaissance Dam (GERD), in turn, powering growth and green energy and earning the country [$55M in 10 months](https://bitcoinke.io/2024/11/bitcoin-mining-revenue-in-ethiopia/), which they are using to build out additional transmission capacity to deliver more renewable energy\n\nThe scientific community agrees: by reducing the financial and logistical barriers to renewable energy deployment, Bitcoin mining accelerates the adoption of clean energy, a finding that is supported by [You et al](https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/acssuschemeng.3c05445), 2023 _(Mining to Mitigation: How Bitcoin Can Support Renewable Energy Development and Climate Action)_ and [Menati et al](https://www.sciencedirect.",

      "title": "Rebuttal: Earthjustice report on Bitcoin Mining, Feb 2025",
      "summary": "Original report: https://earthjustice.org/experts/mandy-deroche/how-much-do-we-subsidize-cryptocurrency-minings-electricity-use-no-one-knows This post argues that Earthjustice’s latest report on Bitcoin mining is significantly disconnected from both the scientific consensus and real-world evidence. By failing to engage with the latest research and developments, Earthjustice risks undermining efforts to leverage Bitcoin mining as a tool that benefits the environmental across a range of metrics. This rebuttal examines the inaccuracies in their report and highlights the growing body of evidence supporting Bitcoin mining’s environmental benefits. For context: in recent times, Bitcoin has emerged as arguably the most important form of climatetech in enabling not one but four critical areas of climate justice. A large volume of peer reviewed research now confirms what Bitcoin mining companies, grid operators, energy experts, and the Bitcoin mining industry have been saying for some time: Bitcoin mining is essential to progress on these four critical areas 1. Remove bottlenecks to getting more renewable energy onto the grid 2. Replace Fossil fuel based heat with electrically based heat 3. Increase the speed and profitability of R&D into new renewable energy projects 4. Urgently end three carbon-intensive practices (gas peaker plant proliferation, natural gas flaring, venting of landfill gas) source These are no longer theoretical benefits, as they were when Earthjustice first started reporting on Bitcoin mining: Finland is now supplying 2% of all district heat through recycled Bitcoin mining heat, replacing fossil fuel-dependent sources such as the burning of coal and peat. 29 Bitcoin mining operations use carbon negative sources such as flared gas or landfill gas for power. OTEC, a forgotten form of renewable energy has had a new lease of life. Finally, since Bitcoin mining moved onto the Texas grid, blackouts have been prevented, $18Billion of new gas peaker plant costs were averted, inflation adjusted electricity prices were kept stable (a rare phenomenon for jurisdictions with rapidly increasing renewable penetration), while solar/wind rose from 80 GW to 130 GW of generation capacity. source Heat recycled from Bitcoin mining rigs running on Finland’s 92% fossil-free grid is increasingly replacing 54.6% fossil-fuel dependent existing district heating sources in Finland The world has changed, leaving Earthjustice behind Earthjustice published their first anti-Bitcoin report in 2022. Since then, the world of Bitcoin mining has fundamentally changed in five major ways: 1. Scientific community puts its weight behind Bitcoin mining’s environmental benefits Bitcoin mining has been shown to accelerate the renewable energy transition (Lal et al, 2023) obviate the need for gas peaker plants (Bruno et al, 2023) stabilize the grid (Rudd et al, 2023) halve the payback time for solar farms (Hakimi et al, 2024) accelerate renewable microgrid development (Moghimi et al 2024) reduce methane emissions from landfills (Sechrest et al, 2024) avert the need for expensive grid upgrades (Norris et al, 2025) with 14 out of the last 16 peer reviewed papers on Bitcoin and energy (87.5%) showing clear positive environmental externalities. 2. Sustainability media gets behind Bitcoin mining’s environmental benefits Of the ten climate-focused media that are commenting on Bitcoin mining and energy, nine of them found strong environmental benefits (90%). 3. 180° turnaround in mainstream media reporting on Bitcoin mining Of the 14 media outlets still covering Bitcoin and energy, 12 are covering Bitcoin’s environmental benefits (85.7%) 4. Bitcoin’s sustainable energy proportion has increased from 49.1% to 56.7% source: Digital Assets Research Institute 5. Source findings of Earthjustice’s 2022 report debunked The work of Alex de Vries and authors who relied on his findings, which formed the basis of Earthjustice’s 2022 findings, has been discredited due to fundamental flaws in both data-gathering techniques and methodology. source: Sai & Vranken, 2023 Earthjustice has responded by spreading even more misinformation Earthjuistice has not revisited their 2022 position on Bitcoin mining. Rather, their approach mirrors tactics that disregard scientific consensus, which is concerning given the volume of peer-reviewed research supporting Bitcoin mining’s environmental benefits. They have either ignored the scientific consensus, or dismissed the entire body of research as being the work of “vest interest groups” But not only has Earthjustice ignored the undisputed evidence of Bitcoin mining’s environmental benefits, they have put out more misinformation. The misinformation in Earthjustice’s 2025 report falls into three categories The very widely debunked claim that Bitcoin mining destabilizes grids The more recently debunked claim that Bitcoin mining increases power prices The more recently debunked claim that Bitcoin mining does not offer community benefits Let’s address each in turn. 1. Bitcoin and grid stability This claim demonstrates considerable ignorance about the large body of evidence showing that Bitcoin mining stabilizes grids. The claim also reveals a severe lack of awareness about what Earthjustice’s peers in the environmental movement have been writing in climate media for some time. The key point is: Bitcoin does not destabilize grids. In fact, a mountain of peer-reviewed and real-world evidence shows that Bitcoin mining stabilizes grids, enabling grid operators to integrate higher concentrations of variable renewable energy. For example: Lai et al states that Bitcoin mining can “balance the electrical grid”. source Ibañez et al concludes “PoW mining emerges as an alternative that can provide additional income and ancillary services (auxiliary services designed to provide stability to the energy grid)”. source Menati et al found that “the flexibility of cryptocurrency mining loads plays a pivotal role in the reliability of electricity systems and the stability of electricity markets” and “cryptocurrency mining …is shown not to be detrimental to power grid reliability even with significant amounts at certain locations.” source A whitepaper from Energy Experts at Duke University concluded that Controllable Load Resources (aka: Bitcoin mining) help to stabilize grids, and decarbonize grids. source These findings correspond precisely to Texas’ grid operators own direct observations. “[Bitcoin mining operations] have found a way to come into the market and take some of that excess wind in offpeak periods. Then it can turn down whenever we need the power for other customers… And if a generator trips off line can very quickly respond to that frequency disruption and allow us to balance our grid more efficiently.” source: Brad Jones, Former Interim CEO, ERCOT. The early misinformation that bitcoin destabilizes grids is rarely recycled any more, with both mainstream and sustainability-focsed journalists increasingly reporting on how Bitcoin mining in fact has a stabilizing impact on Grids. 2. Bitcoin and electricity prices The Earthjustice report shows an eye-opening level of naivety about the relationship between Bitcoin mining electricity prices and the cost that other users pay for electricity, the argument basically runs like this “We found out that Bitcoin miners pay a low cost for electricity, so we postulate that this means other users are subsidizing them.” To anyone with a basic understanding of wholesale electricity markets, this demonstrates the risks of non-domain experts commenting outside their area of expertise. Not only is there no evidence, either real-world or in the academic literature for this claim, but there is a significant body of evidence to the contrary. For example, Brad Jones, Former CEO of Texas’ grid ERCOT observed that by creating a more competitive market for ancillary services and by finding a home for otherwise wasted wind energy, Bitcoin was “helping keep the cost of electricity low for all Texans” In September 2024, Norwegian residents realized that Bitcoin mining had for years been keeping their power prices 20% lower. After the Bitcoin mining operation left the grid, their prices instantly increased to meet the revenue shortfall. As for the claim “There are other types of Demand Response. We don’t need Bitcoin” As energy expert Tom Algie puts it “Turning off and providing demand response isn’t straightforward. Compensation for traditional DR assets; steel works, aluminium smelters etc, is astronomical. Bitcoin mining revenue is on par with electricity prices, so we don’t need much additional incentive to turn off. This coupled with the ability to be located anywhere, the Bitcoin mining load is one of the most cost effective ways to provide DR, FCAS and System Strength services. It also incentivises overbuild of renewables. Bitcoin miners are also building plenty of energy assets globally.” Further, Inflation-adjusted figures show no statistically significant rise or fall in either electricity or gas prices since Bitcoin mining came onto the ERCOT grid in Texas, giving support for ERCOT CEO Brad Jones’ observation that Bitcoin mining in fact “Helped keep the price of power low for all Texans.” The claim therefore seems to be a false attribution of the impact of high inflation from 2021-2023, to Bitcoin mining. There are now not one but five ways that Bitcoin mining has been shown to keep residential power prices low Creating a more competitive market for Demand Response services (Mitch Klee) Providing more revenue to the grid operators, thereby decreasing the cost burden to other users (Dan Roberts) Reducing costly curtailment payouts to VRE generators (MARA) Helping grid operators to delay the need for cost-prohibitive grid upgrades (Norris et al) Obviating the need for multi-billion dollar Gas peaker plant investment (Rian Dewhurst) Earthjustice’s habit of indulging in domain-naive speculative inference over consulting the existing large body of literature on Bitcoin mining should be viewed as a red flag to environmentalists, policymakers, regulators and others in the climate industry. All should give Earthjustice’s articles on Bitcoin mining a wide berth until there is a substantial improvement in their awareness of both the domain, and the prior body of literature germane to the subject they are addressing. 3. Bitcoin and community benefits While Earthjustice claims that Bitcoin mining fails to deliver significant community benefits, evidence from the Perryman Group and testimonials from local officials like Mayor Ward Roddam of Rockdale, Texas, demonstrate the opposite. Perryman’s report found that in the US alone, Bitcoin mining has created 31,000 jobs brought $4.1 billion in annual U.S. gross product helped stabilize the grid while offering a range of other direct community benefits Community benefits were found to be significant, and included strengthening local public services boosting school funding improving community well-being expanding career opportunities in high-tech fields Improving community infrastructure In Rockdale, one of the major Bitcoin mining hubs in Texas, the mayor confirmed these benefits were being observed: “Bitcoin miners are deeply invested in the communities where they work. [They] are among the largest taxpayers in … our local school district. These companies donate to local causes, including scholarships, police and fire departments, youth sports and … community events.” ~ Ward Roddam. Mayor, Rockdale Conclusion In this paper, two lawyers from Earthjustice have advanced the implausible theory that they know more about community impacts of Bitcoin mining than the residents and mayor of the town of Rockdale benefitted, more about the grid stabilization impacts of Bitcoin than five separate teams of energy experts who published peer reviewed research on this subject, and more about the impact of Bitcoin on cost to other grid users than the Grid operator himself. They have ignored the scientific consensus, the environmental consensus and even the media reporting in the liberal media on Bitcoin mining. While the Earthjustice report of 2022 was arguably forgivable, as none of these five shifts had occurred in our understanding of Bitcoin mining, to write such a report in 2025 reflects a lack of engagement with recent research and real-world evidence, which calls into question its credibility on this issue. But Earthjustice’s report is not just misguided, its irresponsible. As a climatetech investor, I am continually looking for landfill operators where bitcoin mining operations can be set up, because bitcoin mining is usually the only way to profitably mitigate landfill gas methane (a horrendous greenhouse gas). We face considerable pushback on an almost daily basis because landfill owners have read factually incorrect accounts of bitcoin mining’s environmental impact. Such uncritical appraisals slow down our efforts to mitigate methane. I also travel around the world encouraging renewable operators to use bitcoin mining for their otherwise wasted renewable energy, so that they can become more profitable, and pour that profit back into expanding their renewable operation faster. Unfortunately, my efforts to do this are severely compromised by the misinformation they have heard about Bitcoin mining that was circulated widely by Alex de Vries from 2018-2022, and which unfortunately you are still recirculating, and which despite your good intentions actually slow down the efforts of those seeking pragmatic solutions to advancing the green energy transition. By promoting misinformation, Earthjustice risks delaying the adoption of innovative solutions like Bitcoin mining, which have been shown to accelerate the transition to renewable energy and reduce greenhouse gas emissions. Specifically, they risk delaying the point at which we will be able to phase out gas peaker plants, while increasing the chances that retail users of electricity will have to pay a premium for their power. It is important that anyone who chances upon Earthjustice’s report should know that they are an outlier in the environmental movement in that they are still publishing misinformation on Bitcoin mining in 2025. We urge Earthjustice to revisit its stance on Bitcoin mining in light of the latest scientific research and real-world evidence. By doing so, they can align their advocacy with the most effective strategies for achieving climate justice.",

By failing to engage with the latest research and developments, Earthjustice risks undermining efforts to leverage Bitcoin mining as a tool that benefits the environmental across a range of metrics. This rebuttal examines the inaccuracies in their report and highlights the growing body of evidence supporting Bitcoin mining’s environmental benefits.\n\nFor context: in recent times, Bitcoin has emerged as arguably the most important form of climatetech in enabling not one but four critical areas of climate justice. A large volume of peer reviewed research now confirms what Bitcoin mining companies, grid operators, energy experts, and the Bitcoin mining industry have been saying for some time: Bitcoin mining is essential to progress on these four critical areas\n\n**1\\. Remove bottlenecks to getting more renewable energy onto the grid**\n\n**2\\. Replace Fossil fuel based heat with electrically based heat**\n\n**3\\. Increase the speed and profitability of R&D into new renewable energy projects**\n\n**4\\. Urgently end three carbon-intensive practices** (gas peaker plant proliferation, natural gas flaring, venting of landfill gas)\n\n[source](https://batcoinz.com/why-climate-action-doesnt-just-benefit-from-bitcoin-mining-it-requires-it/)\n\nThese are no longer theoretical benefits, as they were when Earthjustice first started reporting on Bitcoin mining:\n\nFinland is now supplying [2% of all district heat](https://x.com/DSBatten/status/1872740512555315559) through recycled Bitcoin mining heat, replacing fossil fuel-dependent sources such as the burning of coal and peat. 29 Bitcoin mining operations use carbon negative sources such as flared gas or landfill gas for power. OTEC, a forgotten form of renewable energy has had a new lease of life. Finally, since Bitcoin mining moved onto the Texas grid, blackouts have been prevented, $18Billion of new gas peaker plant costs were averted, inflation adjusted electricity prices were kept stable (a rare phenomenon for jurisdictions with rapidly increasing renewable penetration), while solar/wind rose from 80 GW to 130 GW of generation capacity.\n\n[source](https://batcoinz.com/why-climate-action-doesnt-just-benefit-from-bitcoin-mining-it-requires-it/)\n\n![](https://batcoinz.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Screen-Shot-2025-02-23-at-8.56.17-PM-1024x726.png)\n\nHeat recycled from Bitcoin mining rigs running on [Finland’s 92% fossil-free grid](https://www.treasuryfinland.fi/investor-relations/sustainability-and-finnish-government-bonds/data-and-facts-energy-transition/#:~:text=Finland's%20energy%20mix%20is%20well,second%20highest%20in%20the%20EU.) is increasingly  \nreplacing [54.6% fossil-fuel dependent](https://www.statista.com/statistics/660023/finland-type-of-fuels-used-for-district-heating/) existing district heating sources in Finland\n\nThe world has changed, leaving Earthjustice behind\n--------------------------------------------------\n\nEarthjustice published their first anti-Bitcoin report in 2022. Since then, the world of Bitcoin mining has fundamentally changed in five major ways:\n\n**1\\. Scientific community puts its weight behind Bitcoin mining’s environmental benefits**\n\nBitcoin mining has been shown to\n\n*   accelerate the renewable energy transition ([Lal et al](https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/acssuschemeng.3c05445), 2023)\n*   obviate the need for gas peaker plants ([Bruno et al](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0928765523000313), 2023)\n*   stabilize the grid ([Rudd et al](https://www.mdpi.com/2078-1547/14/4/47), 2023)\n*   halve the payback time for solar farms ([Hakimi et al](https://www.cell.com/heliyon/fulltext/S2405-8440\\(24\\)15796-9), 2024)\n*   accelerate renewable microgrid development ([Moghimi et al](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0142061524001364) 2024)\n*   reduce methane emissions from landfills ([Sechrest et al](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0959652624029652?via%3Dihub), 2024)\n*   avert the need for expensive [grid upgrades](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/danielsbatten_waited-34-months-for-this-moment-in-march-activity-7296373253453819905-Y2SK?utm_source=share&utm_medium=member_desktop&rcm=ACoAAAAOueQB3LYz-BPTBFwVPl9wJVYdGJiKUow) ([Norris et al](https://nicholasinstitute.duke.edu/sites/default/files/publications/rethinking-load-growth.pdf), 2025)\n\nwith [14 out of the last 16](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/danielsbatten_from-mining-to-mitigation-how-bitcoin-can-activity-7280429495679963136-2E-q?utm_source=share&utm_medium=member_desktop&rcm=ACoAAAAOueQB3LYz-BPTBFwVPl9wJVYdGJiKUow) peer reviewed papers on Bitcoin and energy (87.5%) showing clear positive environmental externalities.\n\n**2\\.

Source findings of Earthjustice’s 2022 report debunked**\n\nThe work of Alex de Vries and authors who relied on his findings, which formed the basis of Earthjustice’s 2022 findings, has been discredited due to fundamental flaws in both data-gathering techniques and methodology.\n\nsource: [Sai & Vranken](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2096720923000441?via%3Dihub), 2023\n\nEarthjustice has responded by spreading even more misinformation\n----------------------------------------------------------------\n\nEarthjuistice has not revisited their 2022 position on Bitcoin mining. Rather, their approach mirrors tactics that disregard scientific consensus, which is concerning given the volume of peer-reviewed research supporting Bitcoin mining’s environmental benefits. They have either ignored the scientific consensus, or dismissed the entire body of research as being the work of “vest interest groups”\n\nBut not only has Earthjustice ignored the undisputed evidence of Bitcoin mining’s environmental benefits, they have put out more misinformation.\n\nThe misinformation in Earthjustice’s 2025 report falls into three categories\n\n1.  The very widely debunked claim that Bitcoin mining destabilizes grids\n2.  The more recently debunked claim that Bitcoin mining increases power prices\n3.  The more recently debunked claim that Bitcoin mining does not offer community benefits\n\nLet’s address each in turn.\n\n### 1\\. Bitcoin and grid stability\n\nThis claim demonstrates considerable ignorance about the large body of evidence showing that Bitcoin mining stabilizes grids. The claim also reveals a severe lack of awareness about what Earthjustice’s peers in the environmental movement have been writing in climate media for some time.\n\nThe key point is: Bitcoin does not destabilize grids. In fact, a mountain of peer-reviewed and real-world evidence shows that Bitcoin mining stabilizes grids, enabling grid operators to integrate higher concentrations of variable renewable energy.\n\nFor example:\n\n1.

[Menati et al](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S266679242300015X) found that “the flexibility of cryptocurrency mining loads plays a pivotal role in the reliability of electricity systems and the stability of electricity markets” and “cryptocurrency mining …is shown not to be detrimental to power grid reliability even with significant amounts at certain locations.” [source](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S266679242300015X)\n4.

      "title": "Bitcoin coverage as a litmus test for media reliability",
      "summary": "Overview Bitcoin coverage is a strong gauge of media integrity because it exposes outlets that prioritize sensationalism over facts, lack technical understanding, or succumb to ideological/industry bias. It is also an effective gauge of a media outlet’s neutrality, investigative rigor, and thorough fact-checking because it is a complex, polarizing topic that demands unbiased analysis and meticulous research to navigate its technical, economic, and environmental dimensions accurately. Outlets that excel, such as Forbes with its detailed reports integrating peer-reviewed research on Bitcoin mining’s environmental benefits, demonstrate a commitment to neutral appraisal and depth, suggesting broader journalistic integrity. Conversely, outlets like The New York Times show clear evidence of employing a morality play framing with heroes and villains, which tends to work against nuance and leads to looking for data to support the narrative, rather than the other way around. The Economist, marked by persistent falsehoods, reveals biases and lapses in fact-checking that likely extend to other subjects. The topic’s technical nature and the diversity of stakeholder interests—ranging from environmentalists to financial innovators—require outlets to conduct independent and critical analysis, and verify claims rigorously, making their Bitcoin reporting a good litmus test for overall reliability. Methodology This report provides a comprehensive analysis of the media reliability index for major outlets’ coverage of Bitcoin, as of June 11, 2025. The index evaluates five sub-measures: 1. Ability to Conduct Novel Research (vs. relying on cut-and-paste reporting), 2. Depth of Thinking (over sensationalist headlines), 3. Neutral Appraisal (presenting a balanced view), 4. Avoidance of Groupthink (challenging prevailing narratives), 5. Speed in Overcoming Negativity Bias (moving past initial bias toward an evidence-based assessment). Coverage of any novel technology is generally a good way to stress-test reliability of media, being the area where faults in fact checking are most likely to be revealed. We can see this in media coverage across time of novel technologies including the bicycle, the radio and the Internet, all of which revealed where media outlets were more likely to favor recycling of other journalists’ work, sensational headlines and non-neutral appraisals with a general disinclination to challenge prevailing narratives for some time. Each was scored on a 0-10 scale. The following sections detail the methodology, findings, and commentary, ensuring a thorough understanding of the results, with specific recalibrations for BBC and New York Times Survey Scope The analysis began by collecting posts from July 2022- June 2025 for a range of mainstream media outlets that regularly comment on Bitcoin: Verge, WIRED, The Guardian, New York Times, The Economist, The Financial Times, Bloomberg, BBC, Forbes, Reuters, CNBC, and The Street. The posts were analyzed for sentiments—criticisms, praises, or neutral mentions—related to each outlet’s Bitcoin coverage. Next, scores were inferred based on the content of each article from each media outlet. Detailed Findings The resulting media reliability index is presented in the table below, ranked from best to worst based on average scores.

Bloomberg: The coverage stands out for recognizing Bitcoin’s environmental advantages, such as reporting on miners utilizing Iceland’s renewable energy surplus, with Neutral Appraisal (8/10) as the most salient, averaging 7.4. Reuters: The coverage mirrors Bloomberg’s nuanced framing of Bitcoin mining, exemplified by reporting on MARA’s methane emission reduction efforts, and use of stranded energy in Iceland, with Neutral Appraisal (8/10) driving the average of 7.4. CNBC: The coverage offers a balanced perspective, notably acknowledging Bitcoin’s contribution to African renewables, with Overcoming Negativity Bias (6/10) as the most relevant, averaging 6.4. BBC: The coverage features a positive report on Bitcoin mining’s role in rural electrification, with Overcoming Negativity Bias (6/10) as the key improvement. The history of non-nuanced framing, including use of non-peer reviewed science for sensationalist headlines dragged down the score, averaging 4.8. The Financial Times: The coverage reflects a mixed track record, with a pro-Bitcoin ESG article in December 2023 undermined by later critiques, with Neutral Appraisal (3/10) highlighting the inconsistency, averaging 4.2. The Guardian: The coverage is marred by significant errors, and lack of fact checking such as mislabeling gas plant noise as cryptocurrency mining sound, with Neutral Appraisal (2/10) as the most critical weakness, averaging 2.8. WIRED: The coverage includes instances of many misleading and factually incorrect claims. For example, WIRED claimed that Bitcoin mining destabilizes grids, despite the fact this has been debunked in peer reviewed research (their article was also community noted). Neutral Appraisal (2/10) was their lowest rating, averaging 2.8. New York Times: The coverage reveals a consistent framing of Bitcoin mining as a villain in a morality play. Of particular note was a 2023 article which selectively used data, and misusing marginal emissions accounting to create a heavily distorted view of Bitcoin mining. Neutral Appraisal (1/10) as the most glaring deficiency, averaging 2.6. The Verge: The coverage exhibits severe factual errors, such as unsupported claims about IMF paper momentum, with Avoidance of Groupthink (1/10) as the most prominent failing, averaging 2.0. The Economist: The coverage reflects the most pronounced falsehoods about Bitcoin, with Overcoming Negativity Bias (1/10) as the most critical shortcoming, averaging 1.8. Implications and Use as a Reliability Tool This index reflects how each outlet handles Bitcoin coverage, providing insight into their broader journalistic reliability. Higher-scoring outlets like Forbes and The Street demonstrate a commitment to balanced, informed reporting and re-evaluation of previous articles based on new evidence. Less reliable outlets like The Economist and The Verge show persistent issues with bias and accuracy. The BBC’s rating of 4.8 acknowledges its recent positive article on Bitcoin Mining but notes that this is an outlier in an overall trend of inaccuracies and non-objective appraisal. The NYTimes’ score of 2.6 highlights its lack of nuance in appraising Bitcoin, and evidence of using data selectively to suit a narrative, plus the impact of its much criticized article on Bitcoin mining in 2023.",

Next, scores were inferred based on the content of each article from each media outlet. \n\n### Detailed Findings\n\nThe resulting media reliability index is presented in the table below, ranked from best to worst based on average scores. \n\n**Media Outlet**\n\n**Novel Research**\n\n**Depth of Thinking**\n\n**Neutral Appraisal**\n\n**Avoidance of Groupthink**\n\n**Overcoming Negativity Bias**\n\n**Average Score**\n\nForbes\n\n8\n\n8\n\n9\n\n9\n\n8\n\n8.4\n\nThe Street\n\n7\n\n7\n\n8\n\n8\n\n8\n\n7.6\n\nBloomberg\n\n7\n\n7\n\n8\n\n8\n\n7\n\n7.4\n\nReuters\n\n7\n\n7\n\n8\n\n8\n\n7\n\n7.4\n\nCNBC\n\n6\n\n6\n\n7\n\n7\n\n6\n\n6.4\n\nBBC\n\n4\n\n5\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n4.8\n\nThe Financial Times\n\n5\n\n4\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n4.2\n\nThe Guardian\n\n3\n\n4\n\n2\n\n3\n\n2\n\n2.8\n\nWIRED\n\n3\n\n4\n\n2\n\n2\n\n3\n\n2.8\n\nNew York Times\n\n3\n\n5\n\n1\n\n2\n\n2\n\n2.6\n\nThe Verge\n\n2\n\n3\n\n2\n\n1\n\n2\n\n2.0\n\nThe Economist\n\n2\n\n3\n\n1\n\n2\n\n1\n\n1.8\n\n### Individual Outlet Analysis\n\nBelow is a detailed commentary for each outlet\n\n**The Street**: The coverage marks a significant evolution in perspective, highlighted by an article asserting Bitcoin’s role in the future of finance and renewable energy, with Overcoming Negativity Bias (8/10) as the key factor, averaging 7.6.\n\n**Bloomberg**: The coverage stands out for recognizing Bitcoin’s environmental advantages, such as reporting on miners utilizing Iceland’s renewable energy surplus, with Neutral Appraisal (8/10) as the most salient, averaging 7.4.\n\n**Reuters**: The coverage mirrors Bloomberg’s nuanced framing of Bitcoin mining, exemplified by reporting on MARA’s methane emission reduction efforts, and use of stranded energy in Iceland, with Neutral Appraisal (8/10) driving the average of 7.4.\n\n**CNBC**: The coverage offers a balanced perspective, notably acknowledging Bitcoin’s contribution to African renewables, with Overcoming Negativity Bias (6/10) as the most relevant, averaging 6.4.\n\n**BBC**: The coverage features a positive report on Bitcoin mining’s role in rural electrification, with Overcoming Negativity Bias (6/10) as the key improvement. The history of non-nuanced framing, including use of non-peer reviewed science for sensationalist headlines dragged down the score, averaging 4.8.\n\n**The Financial Times**: The coverage reflects a mixed track record, with a pro-Bitcoin ESG article in December 2023 undermined by later critiques, with Neutral Appraisal (3/10) highlighting the inconsistency, averaging 4.2.\n\n**The Guardian**: The coverage is marred by significant errors, and lack of fact checking such as mislabeling gas plant noise as cryptocurrency mining sound, with Neutral Appraisal (2/10) as the most critical weakness, averaging 2.8.\n\n**WIRED**: The coverage includes instances of many misleading and factually incorrect claims. For example, WIRED claimed that Bitcoin mining destabilizes grids, despite the fact this has been debunked in peer reviewed research (their article was also community noted). Neutral Appraisal (2/10) was their lowest rating, averaging 2.8.\n\n**New York Times**: The coverage reveals a consistent framing of Bitcoin mining as a villain in a morality play. Of particular note was a 2023 article which selectively used data, and misusing marginal emissions accounting to create a heavily distorted view of Bitcoin mining. Neutral Appraisal (1/10) as the most glaring deficiency, averaging 2.6.\n\n**The Verge**: The coverage exhibits severe factual errors, such as unsupported claims about IMF paper momentum, with Avoidance of Groupthink (1/10) as the most prominent failing, averaging 2.0.\n\n**The Economist**: The coverage reflects the most pronounced falsehoods about Bitcoin, with Overcoming Negativity Bias (1/10) as the most critical shortcoming, averaging 1.8.\n\n### Implications and Use as a Reliability Tool\n\nThis index reflects how each outlet handles Bitcoin coverage, providing insight into their broader journalistic reliability. Higher-scoring outlets like Forbes and The Street demonstrate a commitment to balanced, informed reporting and re-evaluation of previous articles based on new evidence. Less reliable outlets like The Economist and The Verge show persistent issues with bias and accuracy. \n\nThe BBC’s rating of 4.8 acknowledges its recent positive article on Bitcoin Mining but notes that this is an outlier in an overall trend of inaccuracies and non-objective appraisal. The NYTimes’ score of 2.6 highlights its lack of nuance in appraising Bitcoin, and evidence of using data selectively to suit a narrative, plus the impact of its much criticized article on Bitcoin mining in 2023.",

Regulations often require companies to hold this information for a set number of years but in practice users should assume this data will be held indefinitely. Data is often stored insecurely, which results in frequent [hacks and leaks](https://www.newsweek.com/binance-hack-telegram-kyc-data-extortion-changpeng-zhao-cryptocurrency-bitcoin-1452989?ref=discreetlog.com).  \n*   KYC/AML data collection puts all honest users at risk of theft, extortion, and persecution while being ineffective at stopping crime. Criminals often use [counterfeit, bought, or stolen](https://www.coindesk.com/policy/2021/10/19/for-200-you-can-trade-crypto-with-a-fake-id/?ref=discreetlog.com) credentials to get around the requirements. Criminals can buy \"verified\" accounts for as [little as $200](https://www.coindesk.com/policy/2021/10/19/for-200-you-can-trade-crypto-with-a-fake-id/?ref=discreetlog.com). Furthermore, billions of people are excluded from financial services as a result of KYC/AML requirements.\n\nDuring the early days of bitcoin most services did not require this sensitive user data, but as adoption increased so did the surveillance measures. At this point, **most large bitcoin companies are collecting and storing massive lists of bitcoiners, our sensitive personal information, and our transaction history.**\n\n**Lists of Bitcoiners**\n\nKYC/AML policies are a direct attack on bitcoiners. Lists of bitcoiners and our transaction history will inevitably be used against us.  \n  \nOnce you are on a list with your bitcoin transaction history that record will always exist. Generally speaking, tracking bitcoin is based on probability analysis of ownership change. Surveillance firms use various heuristics to determine if you are sending bitcoin to yourself or if ownership is actually changing hands.  You can obtain better privacy going forward by using collaborative transactions such as coinjoin to break this probability analysis.  \n  \nFortunately, you can buy bitcoin without providing intimate personal information. Tools such as [peach](https://peachbitcoin.com/?ref=discreetlog.com), [hodlhodl](https://hodlhodl.com/?ref=discreetlog.com), [robosats](https://learn.robosats.com/?ref=discreetlog.com), [azteco](https://azte.co/?ref=discreetlog.com) and [bisq](https://bisq.network/?ref=discreetlog.com) help; mining is also a solid option: anyone can plug a miner into power and internet and earn bitcoin by mining privately.  \n  \nYou can also earn bitcoin by providing goods and/or services that can be purchased with bitcoin. Long term, circular economies will mitigate this threat: most people will not buy bitcoin - they will earn bitcoin - most people will not sell bitcoin - they will spend bitcoin.  \n  \n**There is no such thing as KYC or No KYC bitcoin, there are bitcoiners on lists and those that are not on lists.**\n\n* * *\n\n_**If you found this post helpful support my work with [bitcoin](https://geyser.fund/project/citadel?ref=discreetlog.com).**_\n\n![KYC Bitcoin: Individuals are on Lists](https://werunbtc.com/donate.png)",

Bob has a channel with Charlie. You can pay Charlie through your channel with Bob and Bob's channel with User C.\n\n*   As a result, it is not guaranteed that every lightning user can pay every other lightning user, they must have a route of interconnected channels between sender and receiver.\n\n**Lightning in Practice**\n\n*   Lightning has already found product market fit and usage as an interconnected payment protocol between large professional custodians.\n*   They are able to easily manage channels and liquidity between each other without trust using this interoperable protocol.\n*   Lightning payments between large custodians are fast and easy. End users do not have to run their own node or manage their channels and liquidity. These payments rarely fail due to professional management of custodial nodes.\n*   The tradeoff is one inherent to custodians and other trusted third parties. Custodial wallets can steal funds and compromise user privacy.\n\n**Sovereign Lightning**\n\n*   Trusted third parties are [security holes](https://nakamotoinstitute.org/trusted-third-parties/?ref=discreetlog.com).\n*   Users must run their own node and manage their own channels in order to use lightning without trusting a third party. This remains the single largest friction point for sovereign lightning usage: the mental burden of actively running a lightning node and associated liquidity management.\n*   Bitcoin development prioritizes node accessibility so cost to self host your own node is low but if a node is run at home or office, Tor or a VPN is recommended to mask your IP address: otherwise it is visible to the entire network and represents a privacy risk.\n*   This privacy risk is heightened due to the potential for certain governments to go after sovereign lightning users and compel them to shutdown their nodes. If their IP Address is exposed they are easier to target.\n*   Fortunately the tools to run and manage nodes continue to get easier but it is important to understand that this will always be a friction point when compared to custodial services.\n\n**The Potential Fracture of Lightning**\n\n*   Any lightning user can choose which users are allowed to open channels with them.\n*   One potential is that professional custodians only peer with other professional custodians.\n*   We already see nodes like those run by CashApp only have channels open with other regulated counterparties. This could be due to performance goals, liability reduction, or regulatory pressure.\n\n[!['The Lightning Network' Does Not Exist](https://www.discreetlog.com/content/images/2023/03/cashapp-2.webp)](https://mempool.space/lightning/node/02e1221434a21b8ce5818e92c6ec76301824dc87ed94b4628242e4b1f4a6ff445f?ref=discreetlog.com)\n\n*   Fortunately some of their peers are connected to non-regulated parties so payments to and from sovereign lightning users are still successfully processed by CashApp but this may not always be the case going forward.\n\n**Summary**\n\n*   Many people refer to the aggregate of all lightning channels as 'The Lightning Network' but this is a false premise. There is no singular 'Lightning Network' but rather many payment channels between distinct peers, some connected with each other and some not.\n*   Lightning as an interoperable payment protocol between professional custodians seems to have found solid product market fit. Expect significant volume, adoption, and usage going forward.\n*   Lightning as a robust sovereign payment protocol has yet to be battle tested. Heavy reliance on Tor, which has had massive reliability issues, the friction of active liquidity management, significant on chain fee burden for small amounts, interactivity constraints on mobile, and lack of strong privacy guarantees put it at risk.\n\n* * *\n\n_If you have never used lightning before, use_ [_this guide_](https://werunbtc.com/phoenix?ref=discreetlog.com) _to get started on your phone._\n\n* * *\n\n**_If you found this post helpful support my work with_** [**_bitcoin_**](https://geyser.fund/project/citadel?ref=discreetlog.com)**_._**\n\n!['The Lightning Network' Does Not Exist](https://werunbtc.com/donate.png)",

Since then, the protocol has seen explosive viral organic growth as individuals around the world have contributed their time and energy to build out the protocol and the surrounding ecosystem due to the clear need for better communication tools.  \n  \n_**nostr is to twitter as bitcoin is to paypal**_  \n  \nAs an intro to nostr, let us start with a metaphor:  \n  \n_**twitter is paypal** - a centralized platform plagued by censorship but has the benefit of established network effects_\n\n_**nostr is bitcoin** - an open protocol that is censorship resistant and robust but requires an organic adoption phase_\n\n**Nostr is an open communication protocol that can be used to send messages across a distributed set of relays in a censorship resistant and robust way.  \n** - Anyone can run a relay.  \n - Anyone can interact with the protocol.  \n - Relays can choose which messages they want to relay.  \n - Users are identified by a simple public private key pair that they can generate themselves.  \n  \nNostr is often compared to twitter since there are nostr clients that emulate twitter functionality and user interface but that is merely one application of the protocol. **Nostr is so much more than a mere twitter competitor.** Nostr clients and relays can transmit a wide variety of data and clients can choose how to display that information to users. The result is a revolution in communication with implications that are difficult for any of us to truly comprehend.\n\nSimilar to bitcoin, nostr is an open and permissionless protocol. **No person, company, or government controls it.** Anyone can iterate and build on top of nostr without permission. Together, bitcoin and nostr are incredibly complementary freedom tech tools: censorship resistant, permissionless, robust, and interoperable - money and speech protected by code and incentives, not laws.\n\nAs censorship throughout the world continues to escalate, freedom tech provides hope for individuals around the world who refuse to accept the status quo.

Life is full of responsibility and surprises.** Bitcoin allows us to focus on our lives while relying on a money that is simple. A money that is not controlled by any individual, company, or government. A money that cannot be easily seized or blocked. A money that cannot be devalued at will by a handful of corrupt bureaucrat who live hundreds of miles from us. A money that can be easily saved and should increase in purchasing power over time without having to learn how to \"build a diversified stock portfolio\" or hire someone to do it for us.\n\n**Bitcoin enables all of us to focus on our lives - our friends and family - doing what we love with the short time we have on this earth.

It is hard, it requires immense personal responsibility, it requires critical thinking, but mothers figure it out, because it is worth it.

Unfortunately, broken incentives have led to increased regulation throughout the sector, incentivizing less efficient energy sources such as solar and wind at the detriment of more efficient alternatives.\n\nThe result has been less reliable energy infrastructure for all Americans and increased energy costs across the board. This naturally has a direct impact on bitcoin miners: increased energy costs make them less competitive globally.\n\nBitcoin mining represents a global energy market that does not require permission to participate.

      "content": "[Contribute to keep No Bullshit Bitcoin news going.](https://geyser.fund/project/nobsbitcoin)\n\n*   Wasabi Wallet v2.6.0 \"Prometheus\" is a major update for the project, focused on resilience and independence from centralized systems.\n*   Key features include support for [BIP 158](https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0158.mediawiki) block filters for direct node synchronization, a revamped full node integration for easier setup without third-party reliance, SLIP 39 share backups for flexible wallet recovery (sponsored by Trezor), and a Nostr-based update manager for censorship-resistant updates.\n*   Additional improvements include UI bug fixes, a new fallback for transaction broadcasting, updated code signing, stricter JSON serialization, and options to avoid third-party rate providers, alongside various under-the-hood enhancements.\n\n> This new version brings us closer to our ultimate goal: ensuring Wasabi is future-proof,\" said the developers, while also highlighting the following key areas of focus for the project:\n\n*   Ensuring users can always fully and securely use their client.\n*   Making contribution and forks easy through a codebase of the highest quality possible: understandable, maintainable, and improvable.\n\n> \"As we achieve our survival goals, expect more cutting-edge improvements in Bitcoin privacy and self-custody. Thank you for the trust you place in us by using Wasabi,\" was stated in the release notes.\n\n[![Wasabi Wallet v2.6.0: First Version to Sync & Operate Without a Central Server](https://www.nobsbitcoin.com/content/images/2025/05/image-1.png)](https://njump.me/nevent1qqsqqq8urpkd9t44fken7r6wfhjf4n9z9sp8nhy9gq04cgu00fd9ppszyz0rp62qywxdn6ltccegzakaf5gfsysjj3p09fkrsunlceh6065s5ytnjlx)\n\nWhat's new\n----------\n\n*   **Support for Standard BIP 158 Block Filters.** Wasabi now syncs using [BIP 158](https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0158.mediawiki) filters without a backend/indexer, connecting directly to a user's node. This boosts sync speed, resilience, and allows full sovereignty without specific server dependency.\n*   **Full Node Integration Rework.** The old integration has been replaced with a simpler, more adaptable system. It’s not tied to a specific Bitcoin node fork, doesn’t need the node on the same machine as Wasabi, and requires no changes to the node’s setup.\n    *   \"Simply enable the RPC server on your node and point Wasabi to it,\" said the developers. This ensures all Bitcoin network activities—like retrieving blocks, fee estimations, block filters, and transaction broadcasting—go through your own node, avoiding reliance on third parties.\n*   **Create & Recover SLIP 39 Shares.** Users now create and recover wallets with multiple share backups using [SLIP 39](https://github.com/satoshilabs/slips/blob/master/slip-0039.md) standard.\n\n> \"Special thanks to Trezor (SatoshiLabs) for sponsoring this amazing feature.\"\n\n*   **Nostr Update Manager.** This version implements a pioneering system with the Nostr protocol for update information and downloads, replacing reliance on GitHub. This enhances the project's resilience, ensuring updates even if GitHub is unavailable, while still verifying updates with the project's secure certificate.\n*   **Updated Avalonia to v11.2.7**, fixes for UI bugs (including restoring Minimize on macOS Sequoia).\n*   Added a **configurable third-party fallback for broadcasting transactions** if other methods fail.\n*   Replaced Windows Code Signing Certificate with Azure Trusted Signing.\n*   Many bug fixes, improved codebase, and enhanced CI pipeline.\n*   Added the option to avoid using any third-party Exchange Rate and Fee Rate providers (Wasabi can work without them).\n*   Rebuilt all JSON Serialization mechanisms avoiding default .NET converters. Serialization is now stricter.\n\n![Wasabi Wallet v2.6.0: First Version to Sync & Operate Without a Central Server](https://www.nobsbitcoin.com/content/images/2025/05/wasabi260.jpg)\n\n**Full Changelog**: [v2.5.1...v2.6.0](https://github.com/WalletWasabi/WalletWasabi/compare/v2.5.1...v2.6.0)\n\n[**Announcement**](https://njump.me/nevent1qqsp8cvfcz9788lmhad6ckvqg52r9z8fsl9dk3tcx3exjucv5qlc8vgpp4mhxue69uhkummn9ekx7mqzyzfm6rr08n96u3ec3vq6cm8qktqpxy2defxq34hzwyk5lac5qk3uxxetx9p) / [Archive](https://archive.is/V0VR4)  \n[**GitHub Repo**](https://github.com/WalletWasabi/WalletWasabi/releases/tag/v2.6.0)",

      "content": "*   This version introduces the [Soroban](https://www.nobsbitcoin.com/whirlpool-dencetralization-stage-1/) P2P network, enabling Dojo to relay transactions to the Bitcoin network and share others' transactions to break the heuristic linking relaying nodes to transaction creators.\n\n[![Samourai Dojo v1.27.0: Soroban Network, PandoTx, API Key Management](https://www.nobsbitcoin.com/content/images/2025/05/image-13.png)](https://xcancel.com/PavelTheCoder/status/1925673526255665415)\n\n*   Additionally, Dojo admins can now manage API keys in DMT with labels, status, and expiration, ideal for community Dojo providers like [Dojobay](https://dojobay.pw/). New API endpoints, including \"/services\" exposing Explorer, Soroban, and Indexer, have been added to aid wallet developers.\n*   Other maintenance updates include Bitcoin Core, Tor, Fulcrum, Node.js, plus an updated ban-knots script to disconnect inbound Knots nodes.\n\n> \"I want to thank all the contributors. This again shows the power of true Free Software. I also want to thank everyone who donated to help Dojo development going. I truly appreciate it,\" [said](https://xcancel.com/PavelTheCoder/status/1925609421746389035) Still Dojo Coder.\n\nWhat's new\n----------\n\n*   **Soroban P2P network.** For MyDojo (Docker setup) users, Soroban will be automatically installed as part of their Dojo. This integration allows Dojo to utilize the Soroban P2P network for various upcoming features and applications.\n*   **PandoTx.** PandoTx serves as a transaction transport layer. When your wallet sends a transaction to Dojo, it is relayed to a random Soroban node, which then forwards it to the Bitcoin network. It also enables your Soroban node to receive and relay transactions from others to the Bitcoin network and is designed to disrupt the assumption that a node relaying a transaction is closely linked to the person who initiated it.\n    *   Pushing transactions through Soroban can be deactivated by setting `NODE_PANDOTX_PUSH=off` in `docker-node.conf`.\n    *   Processing incoming transactions from Soroban network can be deactivated by setting `NODE_PANDOTX_PROCESS=off` in `docker-node.conf`.\n*   **API key management** has been introduced to address the growing number of people offering their Dojos to the community. Dojo admins can now access a new API management tab in their DMT, where they can create unlimited API keys, assign labels for easy identification, and set expiration dates for each key. This allows admins to avoid sharing their main API key and instead distribute specific keys to selected parties.\n*   **New API endpoints.** Several new API endpoints have been added to help API consumers develop features on Dojo more efficiently:\n    *   New:\n        *   `/latest-block` - returns data about latest block\n        *   `/txout/:txid/:index` - returns unspent output data\n        *   `/support/services` - returns info about services that Dojo exposes\n    *   Updated:\n        *   `/tx/:txid` - endpoint has been updated to return raw transaction with parameter `?rawHex=1`\n    *   The new `/support/services` endpoint replaces the deprecated `explorer` field in the Dojo pairing payload. Although still present, API consumers should use this endpoint for explorer and other pairing data.\n\n### Other changes\n\n*   Updated ban script to disconnect inbound Knots nodes.\n*   Updated Fulcrum to v1.12.0.\n*   Regenerate Fulcrum certificate if expired.\n*   Check if transaction already exists in pushTx.\n*   Bump BTC-RPC Explorer.\n*   Bump Tor to v0.4.8.16, bump Snowflake.\n*   Updated Bitcoin Core to v29.0.\n*   Removed unnecessary middleware.\n*   Fixed DB update mechanism, added api\\_keys table.\n*   Add an option to use blocksdir config for bitcoin blocks directory.\n*   Removed deprecated configuration.\n*   Updated Node.js dependencies.\n*   Reconfigured container dependencies.\n*   Fix Snowflake git URL.\n*   Fix log path for testnet4.\n*   Use prebuilt addrindexrs binaries.\n*   Add instructions to migrate blockchain/fulcrum.\n*   Added pull policies.\n\n![Samourai Dojo v1.27.0: Soroban Network, PandoTx, API Key Management](https://www.nobsbitcoin.com/content/images/2025/05/image-14.png)\n\n[#FREESAMOURAI](https://freesamourai.com/)\n\n![Samourai Dojo v1.27.0: Soroban Network, PandoTx, API Key Management](https://www.nobsbitcoin.com/content/images/2025/05/dojo-v127.jpg)\n\nLearn how to set up and use your own Bitcoin privacy node with Dojo [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ULZoPMCYPfk).\n\n[**Announcement**](https://xcancel.com/PavelTheCoder/status/1925609410757378206) / [Archive](http://archive.today/xT2sG)  \n[**GitHub Repo**](https://github.com/Dojo-Open-Source-Project/samourai-dojo/releases/tag/v1.27.0)",

Channel peers must support the `option_simple_close` for this new protocol to work. This new feature can be activated with a new config flag: `--protocol.rbf-coop-close`.\n    *   This feature isn't compatible with older LND versions; fee bumping with them uses CPFP. It already works with Eclair v0.12.0 or up, and should work with other implementations as they roll out support for this protocol. The protocol currently does not support Taproot channels and Taproot asset channels.\n*   **Support for archiving channel backups** **in a specific folder for future reference.** It comes with a new config option, `disable-backup-archive` (default: `false`), to control whether previous backups are archived.\n*   [**Support**](https://github.com/lightningnetwork/lnd/pull/8390) **for** [**experimental endorsement**](https://github.com/lightning/blips/pull/27) **signal relay.** Deployed experimentally to assist ongoing channel jamming research, it has _no impact_ on routing.\n*   **Initial support for** [**quiescence**](https://github.com/lightningnetwork/lnd/pull/8270)**.** This protocol gadget is required for upcoming Dynamic Commitments and Splicing features.\n*   **Historical Sync**: Fixed [a race condition](https://github.com/lightningnetwork/lnd/pull/9424) blocking initial sync due to syncer's internal state handling.\n*   **Max Fee Rate** is [now respected](https://github.com/lightningnetwork/lnd/pull/9491) during cooperative close initiation for both parties, not just the remote party.\n*   Lots of other [**bug fixes**](https://github.com/lightningnetwork/lnd/blob/master/docs/release-notes/release-notes-0.19.0.md#bug-fixes).\n*   **Performance Improvements:**\n    *   Limit outbound [gossip traffic bandwidth](https://github.com/lightningnetwork/lnd/pull/9607) with --gossip.msg-rate-bytes and --gossip.msg-rate-burst. Set burst to the maximum bytes transmittable without rate limiting, and rate to the ongoing permitted rate.\n\n*   Ability to use ZSTD for log rotation.\n*   [Remove redundant iteration](https://github.com/lightningnetwork/lnd/pull/9496) over a node's persisted channels when updating the graph cache with a new node or node update.\n\n*   **Functional Enhancements:**\n    *   [Add pagination](https://github.com/lightningnetwork/lnd/pull/8998) for wallet transactions.\n    *   [Make](https://github.com/lightningnetwork/lnd/pull/9562) `MaxWaitNumBlocksFundingConf` configurable for faster test timeouts, with a default of 2016 blocks for production.\n    *   Change sweeper to [attempt sweeps](https://github.com/lightningnetwork/lnd/pull/9627) if the budget is partially covered, preventing delays and high fees.\n    *   [Validate](https://github.com/lightningnetwork/lnd/pull/9603) MPP parameters before payment to avoid path finding loops and timeouts.\n*   **Functional Updates:**\n    *   Enable [log compression](https://github.com/lightningnetwork/lnd/pull/9017) with ZSTD using the logging.file.compressor argument.\n    *   [Enhance SCB file](https://github.com/lightningnetwork/lnd/pull/8183) with more data for last-resort rescue when a peer is unavailable.\n    *   Update channel.backup file at shutdown in LND.\n    *   Introduce [chainio subsystem](https://github.com/lightningnetwork/lnd/pull/9315) to sync subsystems with the current best block, fixing delays in HTLC sweeping due to block height discrepancies in ChainArbitrator, UtxoSweeper, and TxPublisher. Click [here](https://github.com/lightningnetwork/lnd/blob/master/chainio/README.md) to learn more.\n    *   Sweeper now uses [configured budget values](https://github.com/lightningnetwork/lnd/pull/9274) for HTLCs with `--sweeper.budget.deadlinehtlcratio` and `--sweeper.budget.deadlinehtlc`.\n    *   Consider blockbeat dispatcher height [when checking](https://github.com/lightningnetwork/lnd/pull/9501) if lnd is synced to chain.\n    *   Allocate restricted slots for peers via [\\--num-restricted-slots](https://github.com/lightningnetwork/lnd/pull/9458).\n    *   Added support for bitcoin [testnet4](https://github.com/lightningnetwork/lnd/pull/9620).\n    *   [Removed](https://github.com/lightningnetwork/lnd/pull/9621) x/exp/maps dependency.\n    *   Add [\\--no-disconnect-on-pong-failure option](https://github.com/lightningnetwork/lnd/pull/9801) (default: false) to manage peer disconnection on pong failure or mismatch.\n*   **RPC Additions and Updates.** Some RPCs that previously returned an empty response now provide a [short status message](https://github.com/lightningnetwork/lnd/pull/7762) to help command line users confirm successful execution or background initiation. The following CLI commands no longer return an empty response ({}):\n    \n    *   `lncli wallet releaseoutput` (`WalletKit.ReleaseOutput` RPC)\n    *   `lncli wallet accounts import-pubkey` (`WalletKit.ImportPublicKey` RPC)\n    *   `lncli wallet labeltx` (`WalletKit.LabelTransaction` RPC)\n    *   `lncli sendcustom` (`Lightning.SendCustomMessage` RPC)\n    *   `lncli connect` (`Lightning.ConnectPeer` RPC)\n    *   `lncli disconnect` (`Lightning.DisconnectPeer` RPC)\n    *   `lncli stop` (`Lightning.Stop` RPC)\n    *   `lncli deletepayments` (`Lightning.DeleteAllPaymentsResponse` RPC)\n    *   `lncli abandonchannel` (`Lightning.AbandonChannel` RPC)\n    *   `lncli restorechanbackup` (`Lightning.RestoreChannelBackups` RPC)\n    *   `lncli verifychanbackup` (`Lightning.VerifyChanBackup` RPC)\n    \n    *   The ForwardInterceptor's MODIFY option now [merges](https://github.com/lightningnetwork/lnd/pull/9240) custom range TLVs with existing HTLC records, overwriting conflicting values with API-supplied ones.\n    *   [Make](https://github.com/lightningnetwork/lnd/pull/9405) ProofMatureDelta in gossip configurable via --gossip.announcement-conf, defaulting to 6.\n    *   [Add LockedIn boolean field](https://github.com/lightningnetwork/lnd/pull/9602) to lnrpc.HTLC to show if an HTLC is locked in by the remote peer.\n    *   [Allow custom lock ID and duration in FundPsbt](https://github.com/lightningnetwork/lnd/pull/9724) RPC.\n    *   Extend [lnrpc.RPCMiddlewareRequest](https://github.com/lightningnetwork/lnd/pull/9739) to include [gRPC metadata](https://grpc.io/docs/guides/metadata) pairs from the initial request's context.Context.\n    *   [Updated](https://github.com/lightningnetwork/lnd/pull/9772) `PendingSweeps` to return all registered outputs in the RPC response, regardless of future locktime, enabling planning for upcoming sweeps and custom aggregation logic. Added `MaturityHeight` field to `PendingSweep` for absolute locktime value.\n    *   [Add BumpForceCloseFee RPC endpoint](https://github.com/lightningnetwork/lnd/pull/8843), moving lncli functionality to LND for broader accessibility.\n    *   Enhance walletrpc.FundPsbt with an option to [set fees as sat\\_per\\_kw](https://github.com/lightningnetwork/lnd/pull/9013) for greater precision.\n    *   [Add a new option in walletrpc.FundPsbt](https://github.com/lightningnetwork/lnd/pull/8600) to specify the maximum fee-to-output amounts ratio.\n    *   [Sort](https://github.com/lightningnetwork/lnd/pull/9337) lnrpc.Invoice.Htlcs by InvoiceHTLC.HtlcIndex in the list invoices RPC response.\n    *   Set a [default 60-second timeout](https://github.com/lightningnetwork/lnd/pull/9359) for routerrpc.SendPaymentV2 when timeout\\_seconds is unset or 0.\n    *   Include [custom\\_channel\\_data for custom channels](https://github.com/lightningnetwork/lnd/pull/9504) in lnrpc.ClosedChannels response.\n*   **lncli updates and additions:**\n    *   Allow [pre-generated macaroon root key](https://github.com/lightningnetwork/lnd/pull/9172) in lncli create and lncli createwatchonly for deterministic macaroon generation.\n    *   [Add --sat\\_per\\_kw flag](https://github.com/lightningnetwork/lnd/pull/9013) to lncli wallet fundpsbt for precise fee rate specification.\n    *   Include [\\--max\\_fee\\_ratio argument](https://github.com/lightningnetwork/lnd/pull/8600) in lncli wallet fundpsbt to set maximum fee-to-output amounts ratio.\n    *   [Enhance](https://github.com/lightningnetwork/lnd/pull/9390) lncli listchannels and lncli closedchannels output with human-readable short channel ID and BOLT02 channel ID; rename chan\\_id to scid for accuracy.\n    *   Initiate cooperative close flow in [coop close case](https://github.com/lightningnetwork/lnd/pull/9491) even with active HTLCs, disabling the channel for new HTLCs and starting the flow when no HTLCs remain.\n    *   Introduce macaroon constraint for [IP range-based access restriction](https://github.com/lightningnetwork/lnd/pull/9546), expanding beyond spe",

      "content": "[Contribute to keep No Bullshit Bitcoin news going.](https://geyser.fund/project/nobsbitcoin)\n\n*   The Ashigaru Open Source Project has released [Ashigaru Whirlpool](https://ashigaru.rs/news/announcement-whirlpool/), a version of Samourai Wallet’s Whirlpool, allowing users to join Zerolink coinjoins for enhanced Bitcoin transaction privacy.\n\n> \"This has been a huge undertaking and effort for the Ashigaru Open Source Project over the last 6 months, having to get familiar and comfortable with the extensive code base across multiple repositories. It is for this reason our development on Ashigaru mobile has been quieter and slower during this period, and for this we hope our users may now understand our justification as to why,\" was stated in a blog post.\n\n*   Ashigaru Whirlpool retains the core coinjoin cycle design by Samourai’s TDevD, ZeroLeak, and OXT’s LaurentMT, with various protocol enhancements added by the Ashigaru Open Source Project.\n*   Alongside the coordinator code, the [project has launched](https://ashigaru.rs/news/release-terminal-v1-0-0/) a desktop client terminal application (available on Linux, macOS, and Windows), forked from [Sparrow Terminal](https://www.nobsbitcoin.com/sparrow-wallet-v1-7-0/).\n\n[![Ashigaru Whirlpool and Terminal v1.0.0 Released](https://www.nobsbitcoin.com/content/images/2025/06/image-6.png)](news/release-terminal-v1-0-0/)\n\nSource: [Ashigaru blog.](https://ashigaru.rs/news/release-terminal-v1-0-0/)\n\n*   Ashigaru Terminal is a non-custodial Whirlpool client that lets users join chosen pools, enhance their transaction anonymity, and retain full control of funds during coinjoin cycles, without needing a personal Dojo server.\n\n![Ashigaru Whirlpool and Terminal v1.0.0 Released](https://www.nobsbitcoin.com/content/images/2025/06/ashigarupool.jpg)\n\n**NOTE:** _The_ [_Ashigaru.rs_](https://ashigaru.rs/) _website is the official home of the Ashigaru Open Source Project. The project does not maintain a presence on social media, and all second-hand information should be verified against the content on the official website._\n\nWhat's new\n----------\n\n*   **Tor-Only Implementation**: Ashigaru Whirlpool operates exclusively over Tor, preventing clearnet connections to protect against IP address linking and wallet clustering by malicious coordinators.\n*   **Tor identity isolation** is built in to prevent coordinators from linking session IDs across coinjoin stages, ensuring user network anonymity.\n*   **Enhanced decentralization strategy:** The Tor-only setup eliminates DNS dependency and hides coordinator locations, supporting rapid deployment of new instances.\n\n> \"Our coordinator has been further modularized by eliminating the dependency of RPC connections to a local full node. The coordinator can therefore be connected to any Dojo full node over Tor, enabling faster deployment and recovery, minimal hardware resource requirements, and greater jurisdictional flexibility.\"\n\n*   **Anti-Sybil Measures**: An Anti-Sybil fee, fixed at 5% of pool size, is charged for Tx0 broadcasts to enter pools, with a cap of 20 UTXOs per Tx0 for added Sybil resistance.\n*   **Vulnerability Fixes**: RSA keys for Chaumian blinding are not sent to clients, mitigating potential input-output linking risks and building trust as a new development team.\n*   **Output Restrictions**: Multisig addresses are barred as mix-to outputs in coinjoin cycles to maintain anonymity and compatibility with post-mix tools like Ashigaru mobile and Sparrow.\n*   **Code Improvements**: Numerous under-the-hood fixes and optimizations have been made to Samourai’s forked codebase, including updated dependencies, enhanced performance, and architectural adjustments.\n*   **Ashigaru Terminal**: Forked from Sparrow, Ashigaru Terminal defaults to .onion Electrum servers for privacy, with options for private server connections via Tor or clearnet.\n    *   Only native SegWit Whirlpool account paths are supported for hot wallets, with mandatory BIP39 passphrases; unsupported wallet types include Legacy, Wrapped SegWit, Taproot, and multisig scripts.\n    *   Tx0 fee estimation targets next-block confirmation, advising users to wait for lower rates if block space competition is high.\n\n> \"Remote and automatic update of Tor URLs for connecting to both Ashigaru Whirlpool and for transaction broadcast using our “Hanzaki” feature will be coming in a future release,\" was stated in a blog post.\n\nQuick guide\n-----------\n\n*   Check out this [quick overview](https://k3tan.com/ashigaru-whirlpool/) by _k3tan_ to learn how to use the new Ashigaru Terminal:\n\n> \"My advice is to take a measured approach to this. This is new software and there may still be bugs. Start small, get comfortable, then level up progressively. Don't expect mixes straight away. It's important to be patient. Randomness of time intervals between mixes plays a role in obfuscating chainalysis. You should find using the interface overall quite responsive,\" [writes](https://k3tan.com/ashigaru-whirlpool/) k3tan.\n\n*   Ashigaru Terminal is optimized for use with Sparrow Wallet, Ashigaru Mobile, and Samourai Wallet. These wallets support Whirlpool's unique account derivation paths and include spending tools tailored to maintain privacy during transactions from the pool.\n\n[![Ashigaru Whirlpool and Terminal v1.0.0 Released](https://www.nobsbitcoin.com/content/images/2025/06/image-7.png)](https://xcancel.com/_k3tan/status/1937124159588556916)\n\n[**Blog Post (Terminal)**](https://ashigaru.rs/news/release-terminal-v1-0-0/) / [Archive](https://archive.is/7Iv0W)  \n[**Blog Post (Whirlpool)**](https://ashigaru.rs/news/announcement-whirlpool/) / [Archive](http://archive.today/OIL7T)  \n[Gitea Repository (.onion link)](http://ashicodepbnpvslzsl2bz7l2pwrjvajgumgac423pp3y2deprbnzz7id.onion/Ashigaru)  \n[**K3tan's Guide**](https://k3tan.com/ashigaru-whirlpool/) / [Archive](https://archive.is/PZgO9)  \n[Website](https://ashigaru.rs/)",

      "content": "Key Takeaways\n-------------\n\n![TFTC - Market Expert Reveals How Much Bitcoin You Need to Retire! $150K Coming Soon | James Check](https://www.tftc.io/content/images/2025/10/James-Check--1-.jpg)\n\nJames Check argues that Bitcoin has entered a new era of maturity defined by institutional dominance, evolving derivatives markets, and a powerful “buy-side floor” forming around $95K–$110K. He believes Bitcoin’s realized cap surpassing $1 trillion signals unprecedented capital inflows, with ETFs and IBIT options marking a permanent market structure shift. The “chopsolidation” of 2025, months of sideways trading around $110K, has built a multi-trillion-dollar base that positions Bitcoin for a sustained move toward $150K and potentially a $3T market cap. Long-term holders are still selling in waves, but buyers, ETFs, corporations, and high-net-worth individuals, are absorbing supply and holding firm. Meanwhile, retail participation is shrinking, and institutions now drive price discovery. Check views gold as Bitcoin’s roadmap in a global “debasement trade,” with fiat currencies and bonds collapsing in real terms. He warns that external shocks, such as an AI bubble burst, could slow Bitcoin’s ascent, but overall sees the market entering a more volatile, euphoric phase driven by derivatives, liquidity, and demand for hard assets.\n\nBest Quotes\n-----------\n\n“Bitcoiners are sitting on $1.5 trillion of unrealized profit, half a trillion more than Berkshire Hathaway’s entire market cap.”\n\n“There’s something wrong with the denominator. It’s all one trade now.”\n\n“Gold smells out the debasement first, Bitcoin follows with force.”\n\n“We’re not seeing people exit because Bitcoin’s overvalued; we’re seeing people take profit while buyers vault it away. That’s new.”\n\n“IBIT options overtaking Deribit this fast is mind-blowing, this is the biggest shift since ETFs went live.”\n\n“Retail doesn’t move the needle anymore. The sovereign and institutional bid now defines the cycle.”\n\n“We’ve proved a $2T base, now we’re building toward $3T. The era of chopsolidation is ending.”\n\n“You don’t want dumb retail to show up, that’s when it’s over.”\n\n“This time is actually different, you can see it in the volatility profile and the maturity of the bid side.”\n\n“Stay humble and stack sats, the goal is to understand why Bitcoin moves, not to chase it.”\n\nConclusion\n----------\n\nCheck concludes that Bitcoin’s bull market is entering its euphoric stage, supported by deep institutional liquidity, derivative expansion, and a structural shift in market psychology. The $95K–$110K range now serves as Bitcoin’s “HODL wall,” signaling resilience even through major selloffs. As gold leads the “debasement trade,” Bitcoin is positioned to follow, reflecting growing recognition among investors that fiat is failing as a denominator of value. While AI and macro risks could briefly unsettle markets, the long-term trajectory is clear: Bitcoin has crossed the Rubicon from speculation to systemic adoption. Check’s final message is measured optimism, embrace the volatility, stay flexible, and don’t mistake noise for signal in a market that’s still “growing up.”\n\nTimestamps\n----------\n\n0:00 - Intro  \n1:20 - The Debasement Trade is here  \n7:00 - Businesses stacking sats  \n10:18 - James’s report and chopsolidation  \n15:40 - Bitkey & Crowdhealth  \n17:50 - Realized volatility  \n20:48 - Debasement goes mainstream  \n23:56 - Fiat in gold terms  \n27:01 - Are people waking up?  \n30:10 - AI boom  \n38:00 - SLNT & Unchained  \n39:26 - Gold ripping  \n50:32 - On-chain levels  \n58:44 - Retail doesn’t have the power this cycle  \n1:12:33 - Metrics to ignore\n\nTranscript\n----------\n\n(00:00) The era of chop consolidation as we know it is probably going to take a back seat because I think we now enter the proper euphoria phase. The fact that we're still pushing up to 125. Honestly, the market is now saying I want higher. You could be at 150 by the end of the week. People who are coming in now, the traders, the retirement accounts, they just see the IBIT chart.  \n(00:16) It's in a bull market. It goes up only. Bitcoin has this very, very unique characteristic where it lulls everyone to sleep and then it rips. Gold, I think, tells us the future. It's where we're going when all is said and done. It smells out the debasement first months in advance. Bitcoin's at 125 grand. It's punching all-time highs and I just flick through all the treasury company charts.  \n(00:33) Down 85, down 95. Some of them are punching new lows. The least discussed, but I think most important thing since the ETFs, there's a market structure shift has been these IBIT options. This time is actually different and you can see it in this chart. It's just looking at all the major fiat currencies.  \n(00:49) They're all down 40 to 60% in gold terms and Bitcoin is up 50 to 80% more than that. Now, the gold market going up is just raising the ceiling for where Bitcoin's going. Vast majority of these firms had like 0.1% allocated to Bitcoin. Tens to hundreds of millions of dollars. Tiny portfolio allocation. Massive dollars. What happens if they go to 0.  \n(01:05) 002 the most bullish metric of all time in Bitcoin? The realized cap. It just crossed a trillion dollars. I bit as of today just crossed over 58% of the overall AUM dominance. Blows into all the ETFs except IBIT are flat and IBIT is just tearing away. James, the debasement trade is on. New alltime highs are here. It's all one trade, mate. It's all one trade. There's something wrong with the denominator. It really is.  \n(01:33) It really is. And people don't realize it yet. It's fascinating, right? And like I've said this before, I think even on this podcast, it's amazing to me that like bond traders, I love Luke Gman's line, is like they have to lull them to sleep and just like slowlyize the bond market.  \n(01:51) they have to just like pretend that they're going to try and solve this problem. Don't worry, just hold these bonds. We're going to mandate these ones or no, it's okay. We're going to try and get yields down, which means bond prices up. And it's like, guys, it's just they're they're coins. They really are. And this to the skeptics out there, the Bitcoin skeptics, it is astonishing.  \n(02:09) I think uh Mitchell Hodddle, he had this tweet from earlier today. I'll I'll pull it up because I thought it was a good one. uh new all-time highs today and people for better or for worse still believe Bitcoin is a fad. Um not something to pay attention to, but if I mean we've talked about this many times I think how far Bitcoin has come in only a little under 17 years is is miraculous and it shows here like you we'll look back on Bitcoin's monetization and marvel at how fast it happened on the zoomed out timeline of humanity. Bitcoin's takeover happened virtually instantaneously. Truly a zero to one  \n(02:46) moment. Totally. Um, so here's an interesting thought that I'd be curious to get your ideas on. I don't know about you, man. I'm certainly observing that Bitcoin has become desensitized to it. So there's almost this bifocation of how people are observing and and analyzing and studying Bitcoin.  \n(03:05) People who are coming in now, let's call them the traders, the retirement accounts. Like granted, there's still a small chunk of the overall demand. um I would estimate something like 20 odd percent or thereabouts. They're coming in and going like they just see the IBIT chart. It's in a bull market. It goes up only.  \n(03:21) What's not to like? And then people, all the Bitcoiners who've been around through all the high octane phases looking at this thing being like, \"Oh god, this cycle sucks. It's so slow. So boring.\" You've got this real interesting dichotomy where it's like it is monetizing at an incredible rate. Think about some of the headlines that we see these days.  \n(03:41) If you told yourself that back in 2020, back in 2018 for you back in 2013, 144, 15, you wouldn't believe it, right? You just actually couldn't believe it was happening and now we're so desensitized to it. There's like this bifocation of the market. What are your thoughts on that? I think Bitcoin bores people to death. It This is what Bitcoin does.  \n(04:00) It ls people into a state of complacency and uh uncomfortability where they're not happy that it's not reaching new alltime highs every day. But again, it's insane looking at the charts now. We're at $2.5 trillion market cap and thinking back to our conversation earlier this year where Bitcoin had established itself as a $2 trillion asset and it's already added 25% more in market cap since then.  \n(04:27) And it's like what do you what do you people want? What more do you want? It's up almost 100% in over the last one year. It's up 32.6% year-to date. five years up over a thousand percent like it is monetizing in real time. But you were alluding to some things that have manifested over the course of this year that may have some longtime Bitcoiners but hurt because they made the wrong decision. Oh yeah, the old treasury company trade.  \n(04:50) This I mean this is one of those things that like I I love it. Like all things I love the gray zone. The gray zone is where I find it interesting. Um and you know you look at some of the comments I get on Twitter. I was, you know, I poked fun of them on Twitter saying, you know, Bitcoin's at 125 grand. It's punching alltime highs. And I just flick through all the Treasury company charts. Down 60, down 70, down 85, down 95.  \n(05:12) It's like some of them are punching new lows as Bitcoin is ripping to new alltime highs. You just look at this thing like something is going on here, right? That the market is in my view, like my real high level view, I've had this line that MNAV gravity is towards one.  \n(05:32) It appears to be that MNAV gravity is indeed towards one that by the way gravity just means that's the that's the acceleration. That's where it wants to go. There are a handful of these companies that",

Having the backing and buy-in from a mainstream fintech player like Block (Square, at the time) was a signal to the world that bitcoin is something to take seriously. Jack Dorsey and team sticking their necks out to recognize bitcoin as a legitimate value added product to their suite will be recognized as a pivotal point in bitcoin's history.\n\nIt's been more than seven years since Cash App launched buy/sell bitcoin and Block has launched:\n\n*   Spiral - A non-profit organization dedicated to supporting open-source bitcoin development, with a heavy focus on the lightning network.\n*   Bitkey - A hardware wallet that leverages multi-sig to create an easy was for bitcoin users to self-custody their bitcoin with some hand holding.\n*   Proto - A mining company dedicated to bringing open mining hardware and management software to compete with incumbents like Bitmain and MicroBT. The Proto team launched the Rig in August; a modular bitcoin mining machine that comes with a sleek fleet management software system.\n\nTo say the least, Block really cares about pushing bitcoin forward and has backed that up with heavy investments in businesses that support different parts of the bitcoin market.\n\nWith all of that being said, the number one question Block has been asked since they unleashed bitcoin to Cash App users seven years ago is, \"Wen bitcoin in Square terminals?!\"\n\nWell, as of today, the wait is officially over. Earlier this afternoon, Square announced that all of their merchants will immediately be able to convert a portion of their card sales to bitcoin, buy/sell/hold/withdraw bitcoin via their business portals and on November 10th they will also be able to accept bitcoin via Square terminals as well.\n\n![Square Enables Merchants To Easily Accumulate Bitcoin On Their Balance Sheets](https://www.tftc.io/content/images/2025/10/Screenshot-2025-10-08-at-9.26.36---PM.png)\n\nvia [Square](https://squareup.com/us/en/bitcoin?ref=tftc.io)\n\n![Square Enables Merchants To Easily Accumulate Bitcoin On Their Balance Sheets](https://www.tftc.io/content/images/2025/10/Screenshot-2025-10-08-at-9.26.44---PM.png)\n\nvia [Square](https://squareup.com/us/en/bitcoin?ref=tftc.io)\n\n![Square Enables Merchants To Easily Accumulate Bitcoin On Their Balance Sheets](https://www.tftc.io/content/images/2025/10/Screenshot-2025-10-08-at-9.26.50---PM.png)\n\nvia [Square](https://squareup.com/us/en/bitcoin?ref=tftc.io)\n\nThis. This right here is massive. As it stands today, Square supports over 4,000,000 merchants across the United States and every single one of them will be able to log into their Square business accounts tomorrow and decide to automatically convert a portion of their cash flow into bitcoin. If 10% of their US customer base enables this feature that will produce 400,000 new small, medium and large businesses that are using bitcoin as a treasury asset that enables them to help grow their businesses. Don't take it from me, take it from Glenn Charles, who has been part of Square's beta test of this product for the last two years.\n\n![Square Enables Merchants To Easily Accumulate Bitcoin On Their Balance Sheets](https://www.tftc.io/content/images/2025/10/Screenshot-2025-10-08-at-10.07.04---PM.png)\n\nvia [Glenn Charles](https://x.com/GlennCharlesPh1/status/1976039946961158401?ref=tftc.io)\n\nThis is the type of \"corporate\" bitcoin adoption you love to see. Bitcoin is an asset that can help small businesses in ways that most people cannot even fathom. I know from experience, this small (but mighty) media company has benefited massively from our bitcoin treasury, our ability to accept bitcoin for payment and our ability to pay employees and contractors in bitcoin. Opening this up to 4,000,000 businesses overnight cannot be overstated. Most importantly because Square is making bitcoin a first-class citizen throughout the experience, where other payment processors and point-of-sale systems make it hard for their customers to integrate bitcoin throughout the business stack.\n\nOnce bitcoin payments are enabled in a little over a month merchants will be able to receive bitcoin and either convert it immediately to cash or hold it in bitcoin. Bitcoiners who live on a bitcoin standard will be able to spend their sats at many more merchants in meat space. THE bitcoin standard becomes more tangible.\n\n[![Square Enables Merchants To Easily Accumulate Bitcoin On Their Balance Sheets](https://www.tftc.io/content/images/2025/10/Screenshot-2025-10-08-at-10.28.00---PM.png)](https://x.com/owenbjennings/status/1976035183767015909?ref=tftc.io)\n\nvia [OBJ](https://x.com/owenbjennings/status/1976035183767015909?ref=tftc.io)\n\nThe next thing to check off the list is getting a de minimis tax exemption for bitcoin payments.

      "content": "Key Takeaways\n-------------\n\n![TFTC - Bitcoin OG Reveals: Where AI's Billions Are Really Coming From | Aleks Svetski](https://www.tftc.io/content/images/2025/10/Aleks-Svetski.jpg)\n\nAlex Shetski frames AI as an overhyped but useful tool with broken unit economics; each new user adds inference cost, funded by a “circular” VC pipeline that routes money back to Amazon, Google, and Nvidia. LLM progress has plateaued, pushing the market toward an oligopoly while open-source lags at scale. He argues the real opportunity is a new six-layer internet stack that adds native payments (Bitcoin) and identity/social graph (Nostr) to the web, with AI as an effort multiplier: small teams can now ship global, low-fee, payment-embedded products fast. Reflecting digital burnout and content “slop,” his startup Satlantis is pivoting from social feeds to a Bitcoin-native events app, solving real meet-space problems (global payouts, low fees, portable identity, discovery via social graph) instead of competing for attention.\n\nBest Quotes\n-----------\n\n“AI isn’t a second coming of God, it’s a tool, like the tractor or the PC.”\n\n“Every new AI user actually costs you.”\n\n“The money going to startups ends up back with the same LPs, Amazon, Google, Nvidia.”\n\n“Bitcoin dying would be catastrophic for civilization. Nostr dying wouldn’t matter much.”\n\n“We’re not a Bitcoin company. We’re an events company that happens to use Bitcoin and Nostr.”\n\n“The next 20 years will be a renaissance in consumer apps.”\n\n“We don’t need another social app. We need tools that get people off their screens.”\n\nConclusion\n----------\n\nThe episode marks a pragmatic turn: skip AI grandiosity and Web2 clone wars, and instead build real products on an open stack where Bitcoin handles global payments, Nostr provides portable identity, and AI multiplies effort. As users tire of algorithmic outrage and infinite content, the winning apps will re-humanize tech, creating markets that didn’t exist (like Bitcoin-native events) and channeling digital networks into physical community, sovereignty, and durable value.\n\nTimestamps\n----------\n\n0:00 - Intro  \n0:37 - Musings on AI  \n6:20 - The AI business model  \n14:33 - Broad application on AI  \n20:52 - Bitkey & Obscura  \n22:36 - Importance of Nostr, Satlantis  \n34:16 - Carving a new market  \n43:15 - Crowdhealth & Unchained  \n45:03 - The Cold Start Problem  \n53:13 - New layers in the design space  \n59:00 - Improvments to meetups  \n1:04:00 - Everything app  \n1:07:14 - Unplugging and passing the torch  \n1:19:54 - Head down and build\n\nTranscript\n----------\n\n(00:00) that a lot of the money was actually coming through Amazon or Google or Nvidia or something like that. That was sort of like either the LPS or behind the LPS. It was kind of like the wrong kind of circular economy. It was like laundering money. But the concept of general intelligence is just infinite.  \n(00:18) Now we're at a new stage and now you have small startups again can now do payments at scale with Bitcoin. Hopefully do a social graph at scale with something like Nostra and can build faster, better, quicker and go to market faster, better, quicker with AI tools. The cost of Bitcoin dying and failing is catastrophic. \\[Music\\] Stand at the precipice. Gold running to 4,000.  \n(00:43) Bitcoin cooling off after hitting a new all-time high. The debasement trade is on. AI is taking over the world. Or is it? Sitting down with Alex Gretzky to solve all the world's problems again. It's been a while, dude. Yeah, we we solved the world problems like what was it a year ago, 18 months ago. Now we got new problems to deal with. So here we are again.  \n(01:07) Yeah, a lot has changed and we were just riffing on AI. Is it hype, overhype? Is there something there? Is the way it's being applied, the way it will ultimately be applied um in terms of bringing the most utility and productivity to the world. Where are we in the cycle as somebody who has been toying around with it for quite a long time now? Yeah, I think I don't think my opinion's changed since we we finished up and open sourced the spiritual stuff.  \n(01:38) Um, my opinion remains that it's a tool. Uh, it's very much like the tractor or uh, you know, the the PC, the laptop, whatever. It's um I think where I've always diverged with a lot of the overhype um or hype in general is that it's some sort of you know second coming of God or um some sort of sentient being that's going to take over the world and all this sort of stuff.  \n(02:02) I've always felt like that was, you know, the nerd's wet dream, you know, and like overblown uh kind of like esqueologgical um desire to see the circuits take over the world and to prove all the um the religious people wrong, that you know, God can be created in the in the circuit.  \n(02:29) So, I've always felt like there was a there was a strange um sort of desire for that that was completely logical. And we we might have discussed this last time. It's been so long, but um I know I've rifted with someone about the fact that intelligence or the the concept of general intelligence is just infinite. And what we have with the breakthrough with LLMs has been specialized intelligence around the reproduction of patterns um linguistically first and now uh in applications like video but by no means um is this anywhere near a general intelligence nor is it anywhere near  \n(03:02) sentience which is you know further down the track. So there was um I shared a tweet with you now from um from Devon Ericson and a couple other people who sort of like pointing at this which is hey this is a a great tool uh it can be used effectively. Um although as with all tools it's quite hard to be used effectively. Most people just use it poorly and they just get slop.  \n(03:27) And as we're seeing the whole world is sort of or the whole online world is just being filled with more and more and more slop. Um, but if used effectively, um, you can create quite cool things with it. Um, I know, for example, I'm I'm a father now to a newborn and, uh, the little guy was, um, was sneezing the other day and the first thing we did was we just asked Chip, hey, you know, what should we do? Should we get like some saline solution or anything like that? What like what do we do? And we got some good feedback.  \n(03:58) So, so for like for that kind of stuff, it's a super breakthrough. Um, also for things like the video that you guys did for um for the opportunity cost calculator or the opportunity cost app, like that was \\[ \\_\\_ \\] brilliant, man. Um, so so for that stuff fundamentally it's it's great.  \n(04:17) But does that mean that this is um going to end all the jobs and replace all the human beings and give us some sort of sentient being? \\[ \\_\\_ \\] no. like that is just and I think people have sort of slowly come to that conclusion themselves instinctively cuz you know you had GPT3 GPT4 and people like oh yeah by the time we get to GPT5 this thing's going to be like \\[ \\_\\_ \\] god and GPT6 it's going to be running the world and here we are GPT5 is not really any different than four um you know we we sort of had that jump between three and four but since then you know  \n(04:48) everything's kind of tapered off um and all of the different models are kind of you know the same the big guys whether it's Grock GPT Gemini they all sort of like function the same so I feel like we've hit a ceiling there um so yeah that's my that's sort of my thoughts off the cuff yeah the I completely agree cuz it's funny making these videos it's people and we've had a bunch of people come to us like how are you doing this like it like what what is the secret sauce it's like there is no secret sauce like it actually does take hard work like the amount of iterations you have to run through with the  \n(05:27) generations because you understand that the LLM are actually not smart and do not they're not intelligent. You have to literally handhold them and format things in a certain way. You have to bring the context of a cinematographer and a director and understand how to prompt that. Like it's not easy.  \n(05:47) We have a bunch of people in our circle saying a we're going to go do this and it's we're going to create similar memes and short films, whatever you want to call them. And it's like, all right, good luck. Cuz it takes us like a week. The last one we just did took 55 hours of work from storyboarding, scripting, and then iterating on generations.  \n(06:10) And it is simply just a tool that allows us and enables us to do things that would have cost us tens of thousands of dollars and now they cost $5,000. um in labor and minimal cost of credits right now, which they're good. I mean, you pulled up another tweet from from Zoomer. It's like, how sustainable, yes, is the business model for these large language models with how much they're charging customers right now? I think we're probably in a very uh unique and anomalous point in the cost curve for the end customer right now where they're just essentially  \n(06:46) um trying to subsidize this with loss leading by making tokens super cheap when that we know that the power that uh the cost of the power it takes to actually produce the outputs is far exceeds and hacking the hardware as well far exceeds the what they're charging us. This is this is such a good point.  \n(07:08) So, actually I um around around the time when we were sort of trying to commercialize Spirit Satoshi 2 years ago now, um this hit me like a ton of bricks as a business owner because we had spent all of this time um training and building and refining and fine-tuning this the the spiritual associ we had finally got to a good enough model that we thought we could charge for it.  \n(07:36) And when we went to uh some Bitcoin companies to kind of sell it as a assistant, but an assistant that actually understands Bitcoin, um they were only willing to pay like 20 bucks a month or something or maybe 50 bucks a month for it. And when we did the",

      "content": "Key Takeaways\n-------------\n\n![TFTC - Why The US Government is Suppressing Bitcoin Before The Everything Bubble Pops | Vince Lanci](https://www.tftc.io/content/images/2025/10/Vince-Lanci.jpg)\n\nVince Lanci explains how the U.S. government is suppressing Bitcoin’s price through financialization, the same mechanism once used to control gold. By creating deep derivatives markets, institutions shift liquidity and price discovery from spot markets to futures, allowing them to suppress prices with “paper” supply. This mirrors the London Gold Pool strategy post-1971. Lanci argues the U.S. now controls Bitcoin’s liquidity through ETFs and custodial structures, effectively “co-opting” it rather than banning it. Meanwhile, China and the BRICS nations are building a parallel gold-backed system, transforming gold into a high-quality liquid asset (HQLA) for project financing and de-dollarization. Both blocs are repatriating gold as collateral in a global “cabal squabble,” while the U.S. weakens its own dollar through monetized debt and inflationary policy. Trump’s “accelerationism,” energy diplomacy, and tariff maneuvers are part of a race to re-industrialize before the next crisis. Lanci warns this cycle resembles the 1970s: inflationary headwinds, rate cuts into a bubble, and an inevitable recession that resets global collateral trust, where Bitcoin may eventually rise as digital sound money once fiat and gold systems clash.\n\nBest Quotes\n-----------\n\n“When the futures price becomes more important than the spot price, you can influence the market lower by just selling paper.”\n\n“You don’t announce you’re going to create an SPR for Bitcoin. You just buy.”\n\n“China’s building a network of vaults so every country can have its gold close enough to see, it’s about trust.”\n\n“Gold will be carried on everyone’s balance sheet according to a moving average, not the daily price. That’s how they’re stabilizing it.”\n\n“The U.S. is emptying London of its gold, it’s a crisis of collateral.”\n\n“If you can’t kill Bitcoin, you co-opt it. ETFs pull all liquidity to U.S. custody.”\n\n“The ETF is a China closet for Bitcoin, a store of value that doesn’t circulate.”\n\n“The state does two things: it kills people, and it prints money. It won’t give up either.”\n\n“Bitcoin will survive because it’s indestructible, it just needs time and opportunity.”\n\n“Gold bugs and Bitcoiners are fighting the same battle. One raised the other.”\n\nConclusion\n----------\n\nLanci sees the coming years as a geopolitical and monetary collision between two systems: the U.S. dollar empire trying to maintain dominance through controlled liquidity, and the BRICS bloc using gold to rebase global credit. Bitcoin sits in the middle, suppressed but slowly integrating as a parallel network of trust and settlement. Its survival, like gold’s, depends on usage and decentralization beyond ETFs. Over time, the same inflation and debt that erode fiat systems will drive adoption of harder assets. Lanci’s warning is clear: the “everything bubble” will end not with a soft landing, but with a crisis of collateral, and Bitcoin, if allowed to circulate freely, may emerge as the digital resolution.\n\nTimestamps\n----------\n\n0:00 - Intro  \n1:04 - Luongo  \n11:49 - Shanghai warrants  \n24:25 - Chinese bonds  \n32:01 - Bitkey & SLNT  \n33:49 - Gold & tariffs  \n37:46 - Russian war  \n44:11 - Obscura & Unchained  \n45:33 - Bessent’s plans and FOMO  \n51:20 - Copper  \n53:56 - Vince’s neutral stance  \n1:00:53 - Real inflation  \n1:06:47 - Global inflation  \n1:16:18- Bitcoin\n\nTranscript\n----------\n\n(00:00) the futures price becomes more important than the spot price. Then you can influence the market lower by just selling paper. We're kind of in a bubble right now. Are you telling me we're not going to have a recession for the next 15 years? We have to have a recession with inflationary headwinds.  \n(00:12) You can't lower rates without causing a bubble. We can't pay off our debt. So, we're printing money. We're weakening the dollar intentionally. I'll start to say crash if I see a day where every country can have their gold close enough to see to visit. The US is now emptying London of its gold. It's a crisis of collateral.  \n(00:28) You need to have the collateral there. You need to say this is my goal. Trump's an accelerationist. Whether he's good or bad, I don't care. We're going to get to where we have to get faster because of him. Trump and gold. That's your Scott Bessent thing. And that's where Bitcoin comes in.  \n(00:39) You don't announce you're going to create an SPR or for Bitcoin. You just buy. Japan used to go like this. All right. We're not buying enough stuff from the US. What are we going to buy? Cars? No. Let's buy some gold. It's a it's a money laundering operation. There are smart people like Scottas who know what's going on and know the endgame.  \n(00:51) This is best. We need cheap energy. We need a weak dollar and we need to build stuff. I see the energy getting cheaper. I know Trump's cutting deals with Saudis. Vince, I think this was the uh the most enlightening pre-record conversation I've had. We should record that \\[ \\_\\_ \\] for your for your premium people, right? We should have.  \n(01:16) We should have. I you know, I do that when I'm with Tom Lango. We hit the tape before we hit the tape. I hit the tape on my phone. I go, \"Let's go.\" We argue about something like music or some booer \\[ \\_\\_ \\] you know. All right. Tom is Tom is one of my favorite crazy uncles, recurring crazy uncles on the show. He's totally He's totally Yeah. Yeah. We We definitely We definitely um riff off of each other from different angles.  \n(01:36) I look at it from finances and I try and explain the world. He tries to explain the world from ideology and together it's like we're both right or we're both just, you know, lying to each other. Who knows? All right. So, I'm with you. Do you do you pick up uh what he's putting down in terms that uh England still controls the world? the crowns of the world.  \n(02:00) The the the he needs a focal point and that focal point, this is not going to be a negative statement. He seems to focus on a focal point and then he sees the tentacles coming out. I don't see the focal point. It may not be the king of England or the crown. Remember, you know, two years ago it was Davos and WF and the Biden junza.  \n(02:21) That was his that was his expression. And now he's gravitated towards the crown. I'm like, you know what? I mean, when you look at things through the lens that I study and analyze things, which is like him. Um, and that is all you do is you find out who benefits and who suffers and you just keep and you just keep eliminating people until you find out the one guy who's there.  \n(02:43) And I don't know that it's the crown per se, but there's definitely a one thing that he said that's really true is that Europe in general is a plantation. Long time ago, he was talking about this way. Europe's a plantation. They've, you know, feudalism and the people that are in power want to stay in power and the Europeans are still colonizing.  \n(03:06) They're still trying to protect their colonies. And I guess if you want to put a focal point on it, you can call it the crown. You can call it the people that operate the crown. I I think I think I know from a friend of mine who's in uh who's a banking executive here that there's an ideological split and it's everywhere.  \n(03:26) And the ideological split is the the uh European old money. I mean, they don't have anything there. I mean, I'm not ne I'm not anti- Europe like he is. Uh but you know they're doubling down on s say ideology or wokeness and Germany's got no manufacturing anymore. No no I I I I agree with him like I it's it's probably not that in six months you and I will talk about this again and he will say well I know who's pulling the strings of the crown now.  \n(03:58) You know he just keeps going up the ladder right? He was like I hate but I mean I hate Biden because of this and I'm like yeah you're right. He goes, and then he then I will look at Europe and and and England in terms of trade. I'll say, 'Well, this is what's going on here. That doesn't make sense. Italy's getting screwed, yada yada yada. And then I'll say, well, that's because the ideology is driving all the policy.  \n(04:15) Like, I will say the ideology influences policy. Mhm. Cuz I still I still believe that people can at least be semi-rational. He, you know, he's kind of dragging me that way, but he's like, \"No, no, ideology determines everything with these people.\" And it's it's sad, pathetic, but it's true. Like, I'm looking at things differently now.  \n(04:40) Like, for example, domestically, Camala Harris, right? I don't care about the politics. I'm not a political person. Well, I I I identify her as what you would call a third generation feminist. So there's there's there's, you know, real feminists, then there's the their children, and then there's a third generation. Why are you feminist? Because my mom was. Camala is third generation.  \n(04:59) I'm like, well, where did she get this training? And I found out yesterday. Camala Har I'm listening to like the D Kennedys, which is like um uh they have a song called Are you familiar with the band? Yep. All right. So, California Uber, right? It's about Jerry Brown, you know, the hippie who wanted to run for president when Reagan won.  \n(05:18) And uh and and and I'm reading the lyrics and I'm like, \"Yeah, this is pretty funny. It's really cool.\" And then, you know, I'm Where's Jerry Brown now? Boom. I did one of those things on Chat GPT. And uh Camala Harris has came up and his name came up in his bio. She was attorney general for California for seven years under him. And I'm like, \"Oh, that's where you got it.\" And they just gone off the deep end, those people. Anyway, all right, cool.  \n(05:42) Um so I agree with Tom on a lot of things. And when I disagree, I let him know. And it's usually minor stuff. Uh ",

Bitcoin is currently sitting on the sidelines while the precious metal rallies, but I'm not worried about this. It's pretty typical price action. Gold leads, bitcoin follows. However, we're not here to discuss this particular correlation analysis today.\n\nWhat I want to posit is exactly what I expressed in the tweet above; I think people who are looking at these \"overbought\" metrics are going to be in for a surprise over the next decade because they're using metrics that were suited for a particular market regime. That market regime lasted for many decades, but it is becoming clear that something is different in this market. We touched on this last month when we covered the rapid increase in China's gold held on warrant at the Shanghai Gold Exchange.\n\n[\n\nChina Is Prepping For Something\n\nHold on to your butts.\n\n![Can Hard Assets Be \"Overbought\" Right Now?](https://www.tftc.io/content/images/icon/TFTC_02_Black-2--1--35.png)TFTC – Truth for the CommonerMarty Bent\n\n![Can Hard Assets Be \"Overbought\" Right Now?](https://www.tftc.io/content/images/thumbnail/martybent_the_leader_of_the_chinese_communist_party_standing_in_08aec0e9-daa4-4f52-a8b0-4c476efaf81d.png)\n\n](https://www.tftc.io/china-gold-backed-yuan/)\n\nOn Friday of last week I sat down with Vince Lanci, who runs [vblgoldfix.com](https://t.co/ueC1YIUNt2?ref=tftc.io), to discuss this topic (among many others) and what it signals to him, and he expanded on what we said in last month's letter on the subject beautifully. Long story short, China has been building up a war chest of gold for the last fifteen years because in the aftermath of the 2008 crisis they were bothered by the bailouts and fiscal spending. As one of the largest holders of US treasuries, China was uneasy about the growing debt in the US and decided to begin the process of diversifying away from treasuries as a reserve asset. They built up a very large base of gold reserves between 2010 and today, got buy in from other countries who realized the risk of holding US treasuries was higher than they previously thought after Russia's assets were frozen in 2022, and have opened up their parallel settlement network to use as an alternative.\n\nBy putting their gold on warrant and creating a gold vault network across BRICS countries, China can do trade with counterparties using the yuan and those counterparties can immediately take their yuan and convert it to gold. For a more in-depth explanation, I recommend you take the six minutes to watch this clip from our episode when you're finished reading.\n\n[![Can Hard Assets Be \"Overbought\" Right Now?](https://www.tftc.io/content/images/2025/10/Screenshot-2025-10-14-at-4.41.36---PM.png)](https://x.com/TFTC21/status/1977794217343930495?ref=tftc.io)\n\nvia [TFTC](https://x.com/TFTC21/status/1977794217343930495?ref=tftc.io)\n\nIf this is what is happening right now, and I am inclined to believe that it is, I think we're at the beginning stages of this rush to hard assets. Even if you're a country not in the tight-knit BRICS network, if you realize that this is going on you're only move is to begin loading up on gold in an act of self preservation.\n\nThe BRICS countries are currently calling the bluff of the dollar reserve system. The debasement trade has entered the popular lexicon. And the efficacy of the US's perceived leverage is being called into question. This was made abundantly clear over the weekend with Trump's flip flopping on the rare earth metals negotiations.\n\nUsing traditional metrics and heuristics to navigate these waters will be a futile exercise. Fiat is being called into question and many global superpowers are retreating to neutral hard assets.\n\nThe bitcoin price isn't moving much now, but it will most definitely benefit handsomely from this transition. Especially when you consider the fact that it is a strong counter-move to BRICS countries moving to a gold settlement network.\n\n* * *\n\n### Bitcoin is Being Co-opted and Controlled by the US Government Through ETFs\n\nVince Lanci delivered a sobering assessment of Bitcoin's current trajectory in our latest conversation. Drawing from his decades of experience watching similar dynamics play out in precious metals markets, Vince argued that the US government is attempting to co-opt Bitcoin through the ETF structure. He explained that by creating spot Bitcoin ETFs, approximately 70% of Bitcoin's liquidity shifted from international markets into US-controlled venues. This wasn't accidental—it's the same playbook used with gold futures in 1974. The government doesn't need to own Bitcoin to control it; controlling the liquidity pool is sufficient. Through margin requirements, settlement rules, and regulatory mechanisms, the US now dominates Bitcoin's price discovery.\n\n> \"If you can't kill it, you demonize it. If you can't demonize it, you co-opt it.\" - [Vince Lanci](https://x.com/Sorenthek?ref=tftc.io)\n\nVince emphasized that this control doesn't mean Bitcoin will fail, but rather that its path forward has fundamentally changed. The US liquidity network is so powerful that even without malicious intent, it naturally becomes the dominant force in any market it touches. For Bitcoin, this means the derivative price now matters more than spot, enabling the same rehypothecation schemes that suppressed gold for thirty years.\n\nCheck out the [full podcast here](https://youtu.be/_8bmmgOJsIQ?ref=tftc.io) for more on gold market manipulation, China's BRICS strategy, and Trump's monetary policy.\n\n* * *\n\n### Headlines of the Day\n\n[US Government Transfers 667.6 Bitcoin to New Wallet](https://x.com/BitcoinMagazine/status/1978030759613985013?ref=tftc.io)\n\n[Elon Musk Calls Bitcoin Based on Energy](https://x.com/BitcoinMagazine/status/1978014828808519752?ref=tftc.io)\n\n[Bitcoin Adoption Accelerates in Underserved Areas](https://x.com/TFTC21/status/1977901476266864950?ref=tftc.io)\n\n[Hyperliquid Whale Shorting Linked to Insider Leak](https://x.com/BitcoinNewsCom/status/1977875201774718982?ref=tftc.io)\n\n* * *\n\n### Bitcoiners: Don’t let nefarious actors steal your sats.\n\nSLNT's patented Faraday backpacks, sleeves, and dry bags secure your hardware wallet or electronics against hackers and solar flares.\n\nBlock WiFi, GPS, RFID, and EMPs with our MIL-STD compliant tech.

He was perplexed by the notion that bitcoin and gold prices have been rallying as individuals and institutions alike move their capital in preparation for a multi-polar world that will bring with it higher rates of inflation as governments and central banks turn to printing money and high fiscal deficits to paper over the problems they've created over the last five decades. How can bitcoin and gold buyers not see that AI is here, it's going to take over the world and it's going to be deflationary?!\n\nThe irony of the tweet is mind boggling when you consider the fact that a good portion of the stimulus and fiscal deficits described above will be driven by the desire to win the global AI arms race. Governments are going to issue debt, monetize existing debt, and subsidize the build out of grid infrastructure, data centers and on-shoring critical manufacturing capabilities. All of this will be inflationary. The end result may be that we can ping an LLM to do some deep research on a relatively complex subject and it will provide us with an extremely detailed report in minutes for a few cents. And yes, in the long-run, if these AI models continue to live up to the hype, may ultimately replace white collar jobs that cost companies hundreds of thousands of dollars a year. However, the additional productivity gains will be soundly overwhelmed by the amount of money printing that enables them in the first place.\n\nHow do I know this is the case? Because it has always been the case. The other ironic thing about Nikita's tweet is that he seems to be completely oblivious to the fact that tech has always been deflationary and we have witnessed awe inspiring levels of tech deflation over the course of centuries. Here's a picture of the first ever computer that was built by the US Army.\n\n![Silicon Valley Doesn't Understand Money](https://www.tftc.io/content/images/2025/10/Electronic-Numerical-Integrator-And-Computer.png)\n\nThe ENIAC\n\nAnd here's some information about how big it was, how much computation it could handle, and how much it cost to make.\n\n![Silicon Valley Doesn't Understand Money](https://www.tftc.io/content/images/2025/10/Screenshot-2025-10-13-at-9.42.04---PM.png)\n\nvia [simslifecycle.com](https://www.simslifecycle.com/blog/2022/the-journey-of-eniac-the-worlds-first-computer/?ref=tftc.io)\n\nIn today's inflation-adjusted dollars, it cost the US Army ~$8,000,000 to build this absolute unity in 1946. The ENIAC wouldn't be recognized as a computer by people living today. It would seem too dumb because computers have the luxury of using computers that are _checks notes_ **100 million to 1 billion** times faster than the ENIAC.\n\n![Silicon Valley Doesn't Understand Money](https://www.tftc.io/content/images/2025/10/Screenshot-2025-10-13-at-9.43.21---PM.png)\n\nvia my LLM slave\n\n![Silicon Valley Doesn't Understand Money](https://www.tftc.io/content/images/2025/10/image-1.png)\n\nI bought a Mac Book a few weeks ago and it cost $1,000, or 0.0125% the cost of the ENIAC. That's insanely deflationary. And despite this incredible tech deflation, the cost of living has consistently risen over the course of my life and has been accelerating in recent years. The money printer is orders of magnitude stronger than the forces of tech-driven deflation. AI is not going to change that.\n\nThis chart was popular many years ago and it really drives home the problem. (I'd love to see this chart updated through the COVID years. I imagine it looks much worse.)\n\n![Silicon Valley Doesn't Understand Money](https://www.tftc.io/content/images/2025/10/image.png)\n\nMoney printing perturbs capital allocation. When money is printed, it has to go somewhere. As you can see from the chart, the last 27 years has seen a flow of money from the monetary spigots into the market, which has driven up the costs for things that are deemed essential to life in 2025. Medical care, housing, education, food, and childcare. Saving some money on your big screen TV, smartphone and video games is nice, but it doesn't save you enough to be able to weather the forces of price increases in the highest ticket items that are essential to maintaining a life of dignity.\n\nTech deflation is certainly real, and it is certainly incredible for humanity. Unfortunately, humanity is not able to reap the full benefits of tech deflation because people are forced to fight the powerful forces of monetary inflation. If we want to live in a society where everyone has an exponentially higher chance of leading an extremely high quality life in which they can reap the full benefits offered by advances in technology, tech deflation needs to be paired with a deflationary money like bitcoin. As technology makes us more productive, expands the spectrum of potential goods and services that can be brought to the market relatively cheaply and pushes humanity forward, people should be able to buy more for less and save their excess productivity in a money that works for them, not against them.\n\nUntil then, all of the tech deflation we see in the market will be bitter sweet. We're advancing tremendously, but not everyone sees their quality of life advancing. They experience the exact opposite.\n\nFor some reason, it seems that most people in Silicon Valley do not understand this simple truth.\n\n* * *\n\n### Retail Investors Won't Drive Bitcoin's 2025 Rally Like They Did in 2017 and 2021\n\nJames Check raised a sobering observation about this market cycle: retail investors may not return with the fervor we saw in 2017 and 2021. The simple reality is that everyday Americans don't have the capital anymore. While institutions quietly accumulate Bitcoin through ETFs and sophisticated derivatives, regular people are drowning in rising costs. Health insurance premiums are spiking 25-60% across the country during this enrollment period. Germany just announced plans to raise retirement age to 72, with similar discussions happening here at 67. The quality of life for those without financial assets has deteriorated dramatically as real costs explode while wages stagnate.\n\n> \"I don't think retail has the money. I don't think they have the money to come.\" - [James Check](https://twitter.com/_Checkmatey_?ref=tftc.io)\n\nThis cycle is fundamentally different. The mania phase driven by retail FOMO may not materialize because retail simply lacks disposable income for speculative investments. Instead, we're witnessing something more profound: institutional recognition of Bitcoin's role in the debasement trade. While this may feel less exciting than previous cycles, it represents Bitcoin's maturation into a legitimate macro asset that doesn't need retail enthusiasm to appreciate.\n\nCheck out the [full podcast here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4uZW0j-sW6w&feature=youtu.be&ref=tftc.io) for more on treasury company dynamics, iBit options explosion, and the $95K floor thesis.\n\n* * *\n\n### Headlines of the Day\n\n[Mara Holdings Buys 400 Bitcoin for $46.3M](https://x.com/BitcoinNewsCom/status/1977698077675757896?ref=tftc.io)\n\n[Dubai Ruler Hails Leading Virtual Assets Market](https://x.com/BitcoinMagazine/status/1977664686754824649?ref=tftc.io)\n\n[BlackRock CEO Views Bitcoin Like Gold Alternative](https://x.com/BitcoinMagazine/status/1977651735595499996?ref=tftc.io)\n\n[Gold Reaches New All-Time High at $4,075](https://x.com/WatcherGuru/status/1977610193694581152?ref=tftc.io)\n\n[Lagarde Admits Bitcoin Disrupting Financial System](https://x.com/TFTC21/status/1977346762949243139?ref=tftc.io)\n\n* * *\n\n### Bitcoiners: Don’t let nefarious actors steal your sats.\n\nSLNT's patented Faraday backpacks, sleeves, and dry bags secure your hardware wallet or electronics against hackers and solar flares.\n\nBlock WiFi, GPS, RFID, and EMPs with our MIL-STD compliant tech.

      "content": "Key Takeaways\n-------------\n\n![TFTC - Bitcoin's 2025 Turning Point: The Code Change Dividing Opinion | Instagibbs](https://www.tftc.io/content/images/2025/10/Instagibbs.jpg)\n\nBitcoin Core v30 (Oct 9, 2025) is an evolutionary hardening release: it removes legacy checkpoints in favor of a header pre-sync that reduces implicit trust, upgrades P2P robustness (stronger orphan/package relay so one honest peer keeps you synced and thwarts eclipse-style isolation), and deprecates the old BDB wallet for SQLite as part of years-long modularization. The contentious OP\\_RETURN/ordinals debate resurfaces, but the dev stance is to preserve neutrality, don’t damage Bitcoin’s “money-ness” with policy filters against valid transactions. Expect continued investment in fuzzing/security testing, careful tooling-first approaches to any scripting/covenant upgrades, and a pragmatic reminder: if your node secures money, stay updated, the real near-term risk is legal/regulatory pressure on privacy tech and open-source devs, not the code itself.\n\n**Best Quotes**\n---------------\n\n“The checkpoint removal is philosophical, it says the Core devs are not in charge of what your chain is.”\n\n“We hurt the money-ness of Bitcoin trying to save it.”\n\n“An eclipse attack is trying to trick you into not keeping on to a good person.”\n\n“If you don’t run your node with money, it doesn’t matter what you do. But if you do, stay up to date.”\n\n“I’m firmly on team ‘nothing ever happens.’ Bitcoin won’t die tomorrow.”\n\n“Running a node is for you, your sovereignty, your privacy, not for the network.”\n\n“The biggest risk isn’t technical, it’s legal. Developers still don’t have real protections.”\n\n“America could still be the base for freedom through code. If we lead, the world follows.”\n\n“Freedom of speech has strengthened, except when it involves money, and that’s the loophole they exploit.”\n\n“It’s okay if people run their own node software. That’s the point of self-sovereignty.”\n\nConclusion\n----------\n\nV30 won’t “change Bitcoin,” it quietly secures it, reaffirming decentralization by removing trustful crutches, hardening the network’s relay paths, and modernizing internals. The path forward is sober: build assurance (testing/tooling) before new script capabilities, keep nodes current, and defend the ecosystem where it’s most vulnerable, in law and policy, so developers and users can exercise financial speech without fear. In a year, this release is likely remembered less for drama and more as the maintenance milestone that kept a multi-trillion-dollar protocol boring, resilient, and ready for the next decade.\n\nTimestamps\n----------\n\n0:00 - Intro  \n0:45 - Bitcoin Core v30 and the Release Process  \n8:34 - Checkpoint Removal and Code Modularization  \n13:59 - Bitkey & Obscura  \n15:44 - P2P Robustness and Performance Upgrades  \n26:23 - Security Fuzzing and Eclipse Attack Protection  \n36:35 - SLNT & Unchained  \n38:01 - The OP\\_RETURN Debate and Why Updates Matter  \n54:18 - Future Covenants and Scripting Proposals  \n1:06:48 - Privacy Threats and Payment Infrastructure  \n1:20:59 - Fighting for Developer Freedom\n\nTranscript\n----------\n\n(00:00) A lot of people are putting hundreds of millions, billions of dollars even into this asset or completely unaware of the sort of optimizations that you guys are working on. Greg, we meet here on the eve of Bitcoin's death. They could have gone to chain with an old version long ago and you just never heard about it. You're sitting there waiting. You're saying that's weird.  \n(00:16) I'm not getting blocks, but things must be okay. And then on the other side, they actually have taken your money and run. An eclipse attack is a way of using arbitrary network means trying to trick you into not keeping on to a good person. I think most things are happening within the colored lines. It just improves velocity.  \n(00:34) Aside from making sure that this multi-t trillion dollar asset doesn't fall over in the next few years, what would you contend as the biggest risk to Bitcoin right now? I mean, I think it's got to be spicy, Greg. We meet here on the on the eve of Bitcoin's death, October 9th, 2025. Bitcoin Core version 30. Yep. Drops tomorrow. very somber. Very somber.  \n(01:05) Uh, in all seriousness though, I think, uh, a lot of discussion, as we were just talking, um, before we hit record has revolved around obviously this OP op return um, debate whether or not the limit should be lifted or not and the potential consequences of doing that. Uh maybe we'll touch on that, but I think um there hasn't been enough discussion on everything else that's included in Bitcoin Core version 30.  \n(01:33) So wanted to sit down with you and talk about what Bitcoin Core has been working on with this particular version. And I think before we do that for the layman out there, maybe we just do like a highle um a highle refresher of what Bitcoin Core is, what in what is entailed in um basically releasing um new versions, particularly significant versions like version 30. And then we can jump into the nitty-gritty of of what's included.  \n(02:08) Sure. You want me to take the lead on this? Yes, sir. All right. So, basically, there's a Bitcoin core software is the reference client, so to speak, where has majority kind of mind share and running share of the Bitcoin protocol itself. Um, it includes a bunch of different parts. Um, peer-to-peer layer stuff, consensus stuff, um, a wallet, which people still use, uh, a bunch of other like bunch of other tools and pieces in there.  \n(02:41) Um, a major release is done every six months. So, on a six-month cadence, there's a what's called a feature freeze, which is, hey, stop adding new things. Um, we're going to continue just doing bug fixes until this time. there's a branch off which means okay now we have a new fork in the history that will turn into releases that will release binaries based off of this and then eventually a release right with series of release candidates which is happening right now and then eventually a final release. Um in addition to this you also have kind  \n(03:13) of using this forked history that if there's future bugs found if and if and when there are future bugs found and issues um the fixes could be applied directly on these forked off histories and do minor releases. So someday I will very highly likely have a 30.1 for various reasons. Um and this is how that done.  \n(03:36) That's that's done on a per need basis. So right now, if I understand correctly, there's uh 20 and 29 minor releases being cut right now for various reasons, bug fixes and improvements. Um so this can happen throughout this life cycle. Um and then eventually at some point these major releases or these major branches get marked as end of life. So saying basically we won't support this anymore.  \n(04:02) we won't do any effort to like update maintenance to this make buil and make binaries or anything like that and then it kind of gets stale and so that's kind of the the life cycle. Yeah. Yeah. And take an even further step back just on the concept of implementations, right? You have Bitcoin sort of consensus and then implementations like core not le bitcoin uh ptcd.  \n(04:30) They sort of have their own implementations that build software that is within consensus but does things a little differently. Correct. Yeah. So some are complete implementations. So BTCD is a good example that's been around a long time. Um it has it's it's programmed in go the Golang and it has a complete implementation of the consensus software.  \n(04:53) So when you get a string of bytes in the form of a blockchain, it needs to come out to the same exact answer as Bitcoin D or any other implementation that raises the reimplementation raises the chance that there is mismatches, but those can hopefully be ironed out and debugged and fixed over time.  \n(05:16) Um, but there's there's definitely like always it's a very demanding problem making sure they're in lock step of consensus and even between Bitcoin versions there's been historical problems with that uh where implementation details like how the database is stored causes forks in the future right with unforeseen events.  \n(05:39) Um it's been a long time since it's happened, but um it's always possible with updates or or not updating too. Yeah. And where would you say we are um in terms of the path of Bitcoin Core? Cuz like going back I remember my first Bit Devs in New York in 2015. Um Russ Yianowski basically presented on SegWit and obviously we had SegWit getting implemented but I think um one thing over the year over the last 12 years has been made clear to me is that Satoshi when he launched Bitcoin it was a bit of a spaghetti codebase and there's been a lot of work to sort of separate things within that code base  \n(06:20) particularly or not particularly but one thing being like the wallet and the guey um and it feels like the last decade aid of Bitcoin core development specifically has been trying to get the implementation to a point where um things are separated appropriately, more modular and you can begin to do um things that that make it uh more complex, make it easier to build more complex applications on top of the Bitcoin protocol layer.  \n(06:57) Yeah, there's definitely that's one of the major things happening is historically splitting out these functionalities, getting them into their own containers that can be tested separately. Um, so focusing on like the charlatan he's been working on, he's been continuing carrying this torch on the lipcoin kernel. So being able to separate the consensus parts out of the codebase completely exposes an API so people can use reuse this either in in an alternative implementation or just for tooling.  \n(07:28) Um it's not exactly you know a lot of this work is not glamorous in that there's cost benefits to be weighed. Uh the cost is here is that when you're refactoring these very critical parts of the codebase mostly consensus not wallet uh ",

      "content": "Key Takeaways\n-------------\n\n![TFTC - China is Accelerating the US Debt Spiral By Restricting This Critical Metal. Time is Up | Luke Gromen](https://www.tftc.io/content/images/2025/10/Luke-Gromen.webp)\n\nLuke Gromen argues China’s effective cutoff of rare earth inputs to U.S. defense systems marks a tipping point where material constraints collide with America’s debt-driven model and the post-1971 dollar order gives way to a new regime. He says China spent years building leverage, dominance in key supply chains, industrial capacity, and gold accumulation, while the U.S. hollowed out manufacturing and shifted to short-term financing. A hard U.S.–China “divorce,” he warns, would crack Treasuries in days, while China could endure for months. In parallel, BRICS- and Shanghai-led gold settlement is forming an alternative monetary rail; gold now functions as the primary reserve asset even if the dollar remains the primary currency. Washington’s “stablecoin gambit” is, in his view, near-cash deficit financing by another name. The U.S. needs a Manhattan-Project push for metals, refining, and skilled trades, but politics and high-time-preference culture slow everything. Practically, he urges individuals and businesses to adopt hard-money balance sheets, gold and especially Bitcoin, as a market-led path to regain sovereignty.\n\nBest Quotes\n-----------\n\n“There’s nothing more inflationary than an insolvent sovereign printing money to keep the nominal value of its debt high.”\n\n“They’re done selling rare earths into U.S. weapon systems. That’s the end of the post-’71 dollar structure.”\n\n“When the dollar system is coming to the end of its life, you’ll see the dollar and gold rise together.”\n\n“We literally can’t go to war without Chinese components.”\n\n“If America wants to compete, the dollar has to go down 85% against the yuan.”\n\n“The stablecoin gambit is just printing cash to pay for deficits.”\n\n“Deflation is the midwife of hyperinflation in highly leveraged societies.”\n\n“The fix isn’t political, it’s monetary: Bitcoin or gold.”\n\nConclusion\n----------\n\nGromen’s bottom line: China’s rare-earth squeeze exposes the fragility of America’s debt-based power and accelerates a shift toward collateral-backed settlement. The dollar likely persists as unit of account, but Treasuries’ supremacy as reserve asset is fading in favor of gold, with Bitcoin emerging as the free-market challenger. Reindustrialization is necessary but slow; in the meantime, households and firms can protect purchasing power and rebuild resilience by steadily accumulating and self-custodying hard money, letting market incentives, not policy wishful thinking, drive the transition.\n\nTimestamps\n----------\n\n0:00 - Intro  \n0:59 - Tariffs and rare earth weaponry  \n9:50 - China wants recognition  \n13:02 - Alternative settlement in gold  \n18:48 - Bitkey & SLNT  \n20:36 - Stablecoins, reshoring  \n27:02 - Weimar parallels  \n30:10 - Obscura, Crowdhealth & Unchained  \n32:18 - War is not an option  \n39:45 - Western industry weakness  \n49:16 - Fixing the currency  \n1:00:23 - Bitcoin is fixing this\n\nTranscript\n----------\n\n(00:00) There's nothing more inflationary than an insolvent sovereign that is printing money to keep the nominal value of its sovereign debt high. When the dollar system is coming to the end of its life, you will see the dollar and gold rise together. I think it signals that China has a lot more leverage than a lot of the Western commentators are admitting.  \n(00:19) They're done selling rare earths into weapon system for the US defense department. Historically, if you messed with the monetary side of the rules-based global order, US would send the military over and kick your head in. I think you'll come in and you'll see the price of gold up on every day that ends in Y. The Treasury market will blow up in 5 to 7 days.  \n(00:37) China probably would would be able to hunker down and and be all right for 5 to 7 months. End of the post71 structure of dollar reserve status. And I don't think it's ever going back unless Rathon was quoted in the Financial Times saying we literally can't go to war without Chinese components. If we want to compete, people say, \"Well, we need to split China.\" Great. The dollar's got to go down 85%.  \n(00:59) Look, I have to I have to start by saying I can already tell that the uh the comment section is going to be elated for this catchup because this is the first one where you actually have a a mic. \\[Laughter\\] Yeah, I got a lot of feedback on that. So, yeah, the um Mrs. FFTT was finally she's uh she took care of me here.  \n(01:22) So, I've got I've got a very It's apparently a good one. I wouldn't know if it's a good Well, it's the same one you've got, so it must be good. So, yeah, it's um it's it's here. So, that's that's good. It's uh it's this the sound quality is is impeccable. And I think it's important that it's impeccable for this update because as you were just saying, the world is getting crazier.  \n(01:46) And I think we had a stark reminder of how crazy and volatile it can get. at least in markets over the last 96 hours with Trump's Friday true social post that sent markets into a tizzy and then predictable. I recorded on Friday with somebody right after the post went out and I said, \"Okay, we can expect a post on Sunday morning or afternoon sort of backing off from uh his statements.  \n(02:14) \" And that's exactly what happened. For those who are unaware, Trump uh came out and said that we're going to put 100% tariffs on China's rare earth metals um because they weren't cooperating in negotiations. And then Sunday he said, \"Hey, President Xi was just not in a good state of mind. We're back into a good spot.  \n(02:41) \" What is what is this geopolitical volatility signal to you? Um I think it I think it signals that that China has a lot more leverage than a lot of the western commentators uh are admitting. And maybe this might have been the first time where they finally admitted like oh like reading between the lines. Uh I think China retaliated for um the the the latest semiconductor high-end semiconductor related sanctions and and basically my view was like all right well we're not going to you're not going to be allowed to have this stuff.  \n(03:18) That was the initial read. And it's interesting, uh, Trump came out with what they said with what he said Friday, right, which is 100% tariffs and, you know, markets threw a fit. And then the Chinese came out and clarified either a Saturday or Sunday, I don't remember exactly when it was, but and it was kind of like the most Chinese statement ever.  \n(03:44) It was like, you know, this is not a ban, which, you know, in my experience is, you know, is it a ban or is it not a ban? You know, one of my one of my uh uh best uh one of my best sources on China, a friend of mine goes, \"Is it a ban or is it not a ban?\" Yes, that's the answer. That's that's how the that's how the Chinese negotiate. So, but when you really read what they said, apparently it's it's about the weapons.  \n(04:07) You know, it's a ban on weapons. We're not going to supply rare earth to the US Defense Department to make weapons to point missiles at us and our friends anymore. And you know the rest of and and it was interesting because the US spun it as hey they're shutting everybody off and the Chinese said no no no no and so then there was you know Trump tacoed China tacoed or China China backed or deescalated is spun as mutual deescalation um which it was and I think there is still not the recognition there was a moment of recognition in the west of oh my gosh they can shut down  \n(04:46) everything which yeah we've known that all along if you were honest you know if people are honest about the things and not that not that that wouldn't hurt them too it would uh but I think the most important thing is is they're done selling weapons to the US defense department they're done selling rare earth um uh selling rare earths into weapon system for the US defense department which is enormous and I think still not fully digested um you know might being digested by the gold market this morning, which is up 110 bucks as we speak, over $4,100 on the futures. Um, but that's got a lot more  \n(05:24) to go in my opinion to properly digest that message. So, um, I I think it's really important in terms of what just transpired because it's it's they're basically saying we're done. We're done selling rare earths into Western Defense Systems. You know, get your own rare earth. Yeah, and it seems like China feels like it is in a good position.  \n(05:55) It seems like there's been some coordinating in the background to get to this point where they feel confident to plant these these flags in the ground and draw these lines in the sand, if you will. And it pertains to the gold market, particularly what they've been doing with the Shanghai exchange, putting the gold on warrant. And it seems like I had a conversation with Vince Lansancy on Friday and he made a really good point is like they're essentially setting up this parallel settlement network that settles in gold and it seems like the last 6 8 months have really been uh greasing greasing the wheels getting the the slopes ready  \n(06:32) for that. It's on and now they can posture geopolitically from a position of strength. Yeah, I think that's exactly right. And and you know, historically, if you messed with the monetary side of the rules-based global order, the US would send the military over and kick your head in.  \n(06:56) Like that's that has a big part of why Saddam was invaded, a big part of of of what Gaddafi was doing, as we know from Hillary's emails um once upon a time. And the Chinese have been doing this. And so they've they've seen the the message which is when we try to change which they have to because again they're not doing it because they hate us they're doing it because they will literally have a late 1990s Southeast Asia crisis where China collapses like um l",

That was the most active day in markets since the \"Tariff Tantrum\" earlier this year. The spread between SOFR and the Fed Funds Rate blew out to it's highest point since the COVID crisis. Leaving many to speculate that there is an emerging liquidity crisis in the banking sector. Many are speculating that it's coming out of the regional banks after looking at their stock performance today in relation to the Too Big To Fail banks.\n\n[![Repo Madness And Bitcoin Dumps](https://www.tftc.io/content/images/2025/10/Screenshot-2025-10-16-at-10.02.19---PM.png)](https://x.com/TFTC21/status/1978856256761704764?ref=tftc.io)\n\n[via TFTC](https://x.com/TFTC21/status/1978856256761704764?ref=tftc.io)\n\nIt seems that there are also knock on effects of the Tricolor auto lending implosion last month that are beginning to emerge.\n\n[\n\nRegional Banks Crash As More Credit “Cockroaches” Emerge\n\nZions and Western Alliance are plunging as we now learn that, gasp, the credit scandals did not end with Tricolor and First Brands.\n\n![Repo Madness And Bitcoin Dumps](https://www.tftc.io/content/images/icon/apple-touch-icon-24.png)ZeroHedgeTyler Durden\n\n![Repo Madness And Bitcoin Dumps](https://www.tftc.io/content/images/thumbnail/bfmC158.jpg)\n\n](https://www.zerohedge.com/markets/regional-banks-crash-more-credit-cockroaches-emerge?ref=tftc.io)\n\nApparently Tricolor wasn't the only lender exhibiting extremely relaxed underwriting practices and handing out loans to anyone with a pulse. To make matters worse, it seems that many banks lapsed on the due diligence of their counterparts who were giving out these loans. Leading to a domino effect that has forced a number of banks, including JP Morgan, to right-off nine figure loans.\n\nI'm not sure if this is directly related to the budding credit crisis, but the Standing Repo Facility is being tapped for the first time in many years, which signals a desperate dash for liquidity for at least some banks. To get a better understanding of the repo markets, I highly recommend you check out this explainer from Nik Bhatia from The Bitcoin Layer.\n\nLastly, gold is still the hottest chick in the room. It is currently sitting at $4,331 per ounce and the chart is awe inspiring.\n\n![Repo Madness And Bitcoin Dumps](https://www.tftc.io/content/images/2025/10/GOLD_2025-10-16_22-14-03.png)\n\nIt looks like a bitcoin chart, but over the course of 100 years.\n\nSomething is definitely happening with gold. This price action is extremely abnormal and it signals to me that it is very geopolitical in nature. I'll reiterate what I said early this week while summarizing my conversation with Vince Lanci on TFTC, I would not be surprised if China is making the big move to make an alternative settlement network backed by gold and is forcing central banks and governments into the market to bid for as much of the pet rock as they can get their hands on. With this in mind, there are many out there who are disappointed that bitcoin isn't moving in lock step with gold right now. To those people I say, zoom out.\n\n![Repo Madness And Bitcoin Dumps](https://www.tftc.io/content/images/2025/10/BTCUSD_2025-10-16_20-15-52.png)\n\nit's not even close\n\nBitcoin has performed exceptionally well so far this decade and will continue to do so.\n\nGold is having its day because governments are falling back to what they know as the dollar reserve system comes into question.\n\nChina is setting up a parallel settlement network using gold and it's using gold because it's been reliable for millennia and, more importantly, has the liquidity profile to settle the size they need to settle if they're going to compete with treasuries.\n\nThis does not change the fact that bitcoin is superior in every way to gold. It's a harder money that's more easily divisible, easier to send, easier to verify and easier to custody.\n\nBitcoin still has many trillions of dollars of market cap to add before it can compete with gold from a liquidity perspective.\n\nI am more optimistic than ever that bitcoin will reach this point because more people are learning these facts every day and the infrastructure around the protocol is advancing at a faster pace than I've ever seen.\n\n[Square](https://x.com/Square?ref=tftc.io)'s release this week is the latest example of this. 4,000,000 merchants across the United States are currently being forced to ask the question, \"Should I accept and hold bitcoin?\"\n\nHow many do you think will take the plunge? How many more products will come to market that make it easier to use bitcoin? How many more tradfi spasms will there be? How many more inflationary bouts will there be? How many more authoritarian crack downs on financial rails will there be?\n\nIf the answer to any of the above questions is > 1 than you can guarantee that more people are coming to bitcoin over time.\n\nIt's absolute chaos out there. Take advantage of the cheap sats while the sale lasts. And, on that note, look for the Fed and the Treasury to step in as soon as things look like they're getting dire. They will plug the holes with so much liquidity you'll feel like you're at a water park while looking at your Robinhood account.\n\n* * *\n\n### Why Gold Will Never Be Tariffed: The Sanctions Loophole Explained\n\nVince Lanci laid out a compelling case for why gold will never face meaningful tariffs, despite Trump's occasional threats. He explained that gold serves as an \"unintentional loophole\" in the global financial system—it's classified as a good rather than money, allowing nations to circumvent sanctions through barter arrangements. This isn't exploitation; it's an \"honor among thieves\" understanding that all major powers utilize. Lanci pointed to Japan's practice of buying American gold to satisfy trade deficit requirements, essentially using it as a monetary laundromat that keeps both parties happy.\n\n> \"You cannot tariff gold because gold is the intentional, unintentional loophole to avoid sanctions. Everyone does it.\"- [Vince Lanci](https://x.com/Sorenthek?ref=tftc.io)\n\nThe mercantilism principle is straightforward, as Vince noted: you tariff what you make, not what you need. With the US now repatriating gold for its own strategic purposes—likely related to competing with China's gold-backed BRICS initiatives—tariffing gold would be counterproductive. When Trump floated gold tariffs, the market's immediate negative reaction forced a quick reversal. The message is clear: gold's role as a sanctions workaround is too valuable to disrupt.\n\nCheck out the [full podcast here](https://youtu.be/_8bmmgOJsIQ?ref=tftc.io) for more on China's gold-backed currency system, Bitcoin ETF manipulation, and the coming 1970s-style crisis.\n\n* * *\n\n### Headlines of the Day\n\n[Japan Plans Bitcoin Insider Trading Ban](https://x.com/BitcoinNewsCom/status/1978237104787251696?ref=tftc.io)\n\n[Jason Critiques Saylor After Long Hiatus](https://x.com/BitcoinNewsCom/status/1978232578948628609?ref=tftc.io)\n\n[Downing Introduces Bitcoin 401(k) Bill](https://x.com/TFTC21/status/1978208722867589613?ref=tftc.io)\n\n[MicroStrategy Stock Returns to 2025 Start](https://x.com/BitcoinNewsCom/status/1978204783832859080?ref=tftc.io)\n\n* * *\n\n### Obscura – The World’s Best VPN Built by Bitcoiners\n\nCreated by Carl Dong (former Bitcoin Core contributor), unlike other VPNs, it _can’t_ log your activity by design, delivering verifiable privacy you can trust.\n\n[![Repo Madness And Bitcoin Dumps](https://www.tftc.io/content/images/2025/08/newsletter-1.jpg)](https://obscura.net/?ref=tftc.io)\n\n[USE CODE TFTC25](https://obscura.net/?ref=tftc.io)\n\n**Outsmarts internet censorship**: works even on the most restrictive Wi-Fi networks where other VPNs fail.  \n**Pay with bitcoin over Lightning:** better privacy and low fees.  \n**No email required:** accounts are generated like bitcoin wallets.  \n**No trade-offs**: browse freely with fast, reliable speeds.\n\n**Exclusive Deal for TFTC Listeners:**  \nSign up at [obscura.net](https://obscura.net/?ref=tftc.io) and use code **TFTC25** for **25% off your first 12 months**.\n\nNow available on **macOS, iOS, and WireGuard**, with more platforms coming soon — so your privacy travels with you wherever you go.\n\n* * *\n\n### Bitcoiners: Don’t let nefarious actors steal your sats.\n\nSLNT's patented Faraday backpacks, sleeves, and dry bags secure your hardware wallet or electronics against hackers and solar flares.\n\nBlock WiFi, GPS, RFID, and EMPs with our MIL-STD compliant tech.

      "summary": "A veteran broker says America’s $37T real estate market is breaking, and Bitcoin may be its only way out.",
      "content": "Key Takeaways\n-------------\n\n![TFTC - Commercial Real Estate Crisis Worse Than 1990. Bitcoin Adoption Changing The $37T Market | Chris Drzyzga](https://www.tftc.io/content/images/2025/10/Chris-Drzyzga.jpg)\n\nCommercial real estate isn’t just in a downcycle; it’s hitting a structural wall: ~87B sq ft in the U.S., with ~62% built pre-1990 and ~60% privately owned, much of it now functionally/economically obsolete. Rising rates, AI-driven business shifts, and double-digit energy inflation (often ~30% of OpEx) have killed the old “value-add and flip” playbook. Chris argues operators need a four-part reset: (1) a Bitcoin-forward capital plan (treasury allocation, and yield/credit via products like MicroStrategy’s Stretch and dual-collateral loans), (2) energy optimization up to and including integrated Bitcoin mining to turn a cost line into revenue, (3) proptech for stickier tenants and real-time ops data, and (4) modular TIs to preserve capital and shorten downtime. The Fed can’t fix obsolescence or demographics; competing with Bitcoin’s return profile and liquidity requires truly re-architecting how assets are financed, operated, and upgraded.\n\nBest Quotes\n-----------\n\n“I’m not saying real estate’s going to zero, but to proceed like it’s business as usual, like it’s just another cycle — that is a very dangerous approach.”\n\n“62% of U.S. commercial property was built before 1990. Much of that supply is obsolete, and 60% of it is privately owned. That’s mom-and-pop America.”\n\n“When you integrate Bitcoin mining into your asset, you’re not just cutting costs, you’re turning an expense line into an income stream.”\n\n“The real estate industry keeps saying, ‘It’s cyclical, we’ve been here before.’ They’re missing the structural changes right in front of them.”\n\n“At some point LPs will realize they can outperform real estate’s high-teens returns by simply holding Bitcoin.”\n\n“This transition will flush out the malinvestment, separate the pros from the wannabes, and reward those who adopt real strategies.”\n\n“I’d rather trust MicroStrategy’s capital stack than the clowns in Washington.”\n\n“If you think the Fed’s going to save this market, you’re not paying attention, interest rates can’t reverse AI, demographics, or Bitcoin adoption.”\n\n“Bitcoin, energy, and real estate are colliding. We’re taking single-purpose, depreciating assets and turning them into resilient financial machines.”\n\n“When the books are written about this transition, I’d rather be remembered as the crazy Bitcoin guy who tried to warn everyone.”\n\nConclusion\n----------\n\nThis isn’t a quick patch; it’s a decade-long rebuild where balance sheets, financing, and building systems get Bitcoin-native: accumulate BTC, adopt self-custody, explore dual-collateral credit, mine where it pencils, deploy proptech, and shift to modular improvements. Buy only at reset bases (bankruptcy/steps or well below replacement cost) and then run the new playbook; those who do will survive the reset and potentially thrive, while those waiting on the Fed will watch obsolescence compound. The next CRE recovery will be bottom-up and Bitcoin-powered, a grassroots modernization of assets and communities without permission from central banks.\n\nTimestamps\n----------\n\n0:00 - Intro  \n1:00 - Real estate meets bitcoin  \n8:50 - How bad is commercial real estate right now?  \n11:33 - Economics of building ownership and timeframes  \n24:27 - SLNT & Bitkey  \n26:15 - The four pillar strategy for real estate operators  \n31:43 - How the pitch has been received  \n35:23 - Obscura & Unchained  \n36:49 - Regulatory burdens  \n46:10 - Industry is catching on  \n49:40 - Bitcoin cycles colliding with real estate cycles  \n52:29 - Game plan for RE investors  \n57:03 - Improvements bitcoin can make  \n1:00:29 - Optimistic outcome\n\nTranscript\n----------\n\n(00:00) I'm not saying that real estate's going to zero, but to proceed like it's business as usual, like it's just another cycle, that is a very dangerous approach. In the short term, I think it'll be more of a meltup situation. But there's going to come a point in that process where there's no marginal buyer for the bottom 75% of the stock.  \n(00:19) The Fed's not going to allow another real down cycle to occur. There's about 87 billion square ft of commercial property. 62% of that supply was built before 1990. How much of that supply is functionally and economically obsolete? 60% of the supply is owned privately. That's a huge problem. All markets energy the last handful of years is increasing double digits.  \n(00:41) It's taking this singlepurpose monolithic appreciating asset and turning it into this financial machine positioned well for the 21st century. Last piece of the puzzle was cash flow piece. Bitcoin's keer could have been 200% a year. Chris, good morning to you on the West Coast. Early afternoon for me. How are you? I'm doing very well, Marty. How are you doing well? Excited for this conversation.  \n(01:11) I mean, we've been talking about the intersection of real estate and Bitcoin for a few years now. Right before we hit record, you mentioned Leon Wonkom. We've had Andrew Hones on the show, uh, and a few others to talk about this.  \n(01:29) And recently we've had some real estate experts that really aren't focused on Bitcoin that have come on. So I think this is going to be a good continuation conversation. Um and you're someone in the real estate industry in California specifically that has decided to come out and sort of ring the alarm bells in August. On August 20th, you sent out a tweet. That's your pin tweet. A warning and a call to action for the entire real estate industry. Real estate is at a breaking point.  \n(01:56) monetary debasement, 62% inventory obsolete, new financial products competing for capital. And so it seems like you're very well ingratiated in the real estate industry. You're a Bitcoiner and you see the writing on the wall of some of the problems in the real estate industry and you think Bitcoin is a potential solution to the problems that exist.  \n(02:17) Uh that's absolutely right. Um, you know, I I've been kind of watching this, uh, you know, from the sidelines, so to speak. You know, uh, having a career in the commercial, uh, real estate world and and being a Bitcoiner on the side, uh, for almost a decade now. Um, I joke I I tend to round up.  \n(02:42) I'm probably seven or eight years in or so, but um just watching it and thinking through you know what this means and and you know the second and third uh kind of derivatives of the you know the disruption um that's going to take place here and um it's just gotten to a you know a tipping point where you know I couldn't sit back anymore um and just had to speak up started to put uh um some thoughts down on paper.  \n(03:10) I kind of been baking a strategy for a handful of years and you know the really the last piece of the puzzle was um the cash flow piece. So you know I I I've said to others that Bitcoin's keer could have been 200% a year. Um it it didn't matter. There was a large segment of the real estate world that was just not going to you know give it any attention um because of that cash flow component. Um, and there's obviously arguments for and against that. I get it.  \n(03:35) But, um, when Sailor and and Strategy started releasing these preferred offerings, um, that provided that cash flow stream built on top of Bitcoin, that was when I was like, \"Oh boy, here we go.\" Um, now we got to start talking about this because like it, hate it, um, whether you understand it or not, I mean, these are viable competitors um, to the real estate industry, not just the bond markets.  \n(04:01) So, um I I just started talking about it and here we are today. And I think it's good that you're in the commercial real estate space because recently we had um Melody Wright on talking about residential real estate and I I think it's important to draw a line uh between the two and really highlight the sort of differences of each.  \n(04:26) And we went pretty deep on residential real estate about a month ago. And so I think commercial real estate's a different beast particularly in a postcoid world where you had everybody rushing to work from home and uh seems like a lot of the commercial real estate properties were under stress during that era and still to this day.  \n(04:44) So I guess to take a step back and just talk about the problem before we jump into certain solutions. How bad is it out there? Yeah, I mean that's a good question. the the commercial real estate um sector in and of itself, I mean, it's vast. Um people tend to paint it with just a you know, a broad brush, but you know, they overlook the fact of how many different property types and and specialties make up the commercial space.  \n(05:15) And each of them have their own um dynamics, their own supply, demand dynamics that make it up. um you know deals get done very differently um across each of these product types. So, um, there, you know, you we could have a podcast, a long form discussion on literally each one of those specialties, but I mean, just at a high level, I mean, you obviously have Bitcoin, which is, you know, it's going to it is disrupting the industry massively and it's only going to pick up steam.  \n(05:47) But when you zoom out and you start to look at or or consider all the other uh macro forces that are uh colliding at the same time, right? I mean, you cover a lot of them on your pod um regularly, right? Demographics, technology, AI, automation, uh robotics, uh different generational expectations and consumer demands. Um a long-term debt cycle ending a new monetary regime emerging.  \n(06:13) I mean, you you stack all these major um forces up and then you turn around and look at the commercial real estate markets just in the United States and it's in the United States there's about 87 billion square ft of commercial property just roughly. That's the four major food groups um office, industrial, retail and uh mul",

Industry participants and representatives from banks that serve many of these industry participants spent a few minutes explaining the nuances of bitcoin's distributed ledger, private key management, and how it represents a step-function improvement on the incumbent ledger, payments and accounting technologies that banks operating within the Federal Reserve network use today. After that they moved on to glazing stablecoins and the potential for \"tokenizing real world assets\" has to revolutionize the financial system.\n\nI will concede that being able to buy, sell, send and receive tokenized assets using \"blockchain technology\" sounds cool. However, I am very far from being convinced that it is as revolutionary as is being marketed by the crypto crowd. And, furthermore, I would put forth that it is completely missing the forest for the trees. As I stated when Robinhood's CEO Vlad Tenev was interviewed about Robinhood's intentions to tokenize real estate and offer it to their users during the Token 2049 conference earlier this month; this is your brain on fiat. No one needs \"easier and more granular access\" to real estate and stock markets. The avenues to get exposure to these assets are already very well established and the last decade has popularized and commoditized the ability to by fractions of a share in a stock.\n\nIndividuals do not need access to equity slivers of multi-family shit boxes with razor thin margins. THEY NEED BETTER MONEY. Trying to push tokenization so that more people can speculate in the high velocity trash economy for financialized assets doesn't solve the core issue we face as a society today. It will only serve to exacerbate it as the unwitting retail masses treat speculating on multi-family residences in newly gentrified neighborhoods like their meme tokens on pump dot fun. People don't need more and easier ways to speculate. THEY NEED BETTER MONEY.\n\nAlas, you are going to be bludgeoned to death by the constant refrain that tokenized real world assets are here to revolutionize finance and take us into the future. At best, these things are marginally better ways to buy something like a stock, claim you have ownership of that share, and sell it efficiently when the time is right. The TAM for this is not that large. The DTCC, which these mechanisms replace, did about $2.5b in revenue last year. At worst, they are an affinity scam being pushed by a crypto industry looking for its next group of suckers.\n\nAnd the most shameful thing about this push is that it will distract an untold number of people who desperately need legitimate solutions to their financial problems from focusing on bitcoin and it will attract untold billions to be incinerated in yet another crypto startup pyre.\n\nStay humble, stack sats, and avoid the siren calls this cycle.\n\n* * *\n\n### The Stablecoin Strategy: Why the U.S. Can't Sell Long-Term Bonds Anymore\n\nLuke Gromen presented a stark assessment of U.S. fiscal strategy that reframes the stablecoin narrative entirely. He argues that Treasury Secretary Bessent's immediate doubling of Treasury buybacks—heavily focused on short-term paper—signals that long-term bond markets can no longer adequately finance U.S. deficits at sustainable prices. The \"Genius Act\" promoting stablecoins isn't about innovation, Gromen contends, but necessity: the U.S. must refinance debt in near-cash markets because traditional bond auctions are failing. He suggests the endgame involves making stablecoin-backed T-bills non-marketable with artificially suppressed yields, similar to the 1950s financial repression playbook.\n\n> \"They should have called it, we can't issue bonds at the long end of the curve in sufficient amounts at prices that don't blow up our debt anymore.\"- [Luke Groman](https://x.com/lukegromen?ref=tftc.io)\n\nThis represents Bessent wresting control of the short end from the Fed, Gromen explained. While marketed as financial innovation, it's functionally equivalent to printing money to finance deficits without the political liability of calling it quantitative easing. The implications are clear: nominal stability maintained through monetary sleight of hand, with stablecoin holders worldwide absorbing the hidden inflation tax.\n\nCheck out the [full podcast here](https://youtu.be/5cAlghGx5wU?ref=tftc.io) for more on China's rare earth leverage, gold's role as reserve asset, and the cost of reshoring manufacturing.\n\n* * *\n\n### Headlines of the Day\n\n[Fed Injects Another $2B via Repos](https://x.com/TFTC21/status/1980386540514947583?ref=tftc.io)\n\n[Traders Bet on 50bps Fed Cut by Year-End](https://x.com/TFTC21/status/1980376941015585003?ref=tftc.io)\n\n[Gold Reaches New All-Time High](https://x.com/BitcoinMagazine/status/1980363533448802520?ref=tftc.io)\n\n[UK Bank Tracks Spending Carbon Footprint](https://x.com/TFTC21/status/1980356090337587608?ref=tftc.io)\n\n[TD Cowen Forecasts $141K Bitcoin by December](https://x.com/BitcoinMagazine/status/1980339559725711594?ref=tftc.io)\n\n[Scaramucci Sees Bitcoin Hitting $1.5 Million](https://x.com/TFTC21/status/1980339138626011358?ref=tftc.io)\n\n* * *\n\n### Obscura – The World’s Best VPN Built by Bitcoiners\n\nCreated by Carl Dong (former Bitcoin Core contributor), unlike other VPNs, it _can’t_ log your activity by design, delivering verifiable privacy you can trust.\n\n[![Real World Assets Are The Siren Call Of This Cycle](https://www.tftc.io/content/images/2025/08/newsletter-1.jpg)](https://obscura.net/?ref=tftc.io)\n\n[USE CODE TFTC25](https://obscura.net/?ref=tftc.io)\n\n**Outsmarts internet censorship**: works even on the most restrictive Wi-Fi networks where other VPNs fail.  \n**Pay with bitcoin over Lightning:** better privacy and low fees.  \n**No email required:** accounts are generated like bitcoin wallets.  \n**No trade-offs**: browse freely with fast, reliable speeds.\n\n**Exclusive Deal for TFTC Listeners:**  \nSign up at [obscura.net](https://obscura.net/?ref=tftc.io) and use code **TFTC25** for **25% off your first 12 months**.\n\nNow available on **macOS, iOS, and WireGuard**, with more platforms coming soon — so your privacy travels with you wherever you go.\n\n* * *\n\n### Bitcoiners: Don’t let nefarious actors steal your sats.\n\nSLNT's patented Faraday backpacks, sleeves, and dry bags secure your hardware wallet or electronics against hackers and solar flares.\n\nBlock WiFi, GPS, RFID, and EMPs with our MIL-STD compliant tech.

      "summary": "Kent Halliburton on why mining, not buying, is the most sovereign, cost-efficient way to stack “wild sats.”",
      "content": "Key Takeaways\n-------------\n\n![Center of Hash - The Best Way to Acquire Bitcoin | Kent Halliburton](https://www.tftc.io/content/images/2025/10/Kent-Halliburton.jpg)\n\nKent Halliburton (Saz Mining) and Parker Lewis argue that mining, not buying, is the most Bitcoin-native path to acquisition: it converts cheap, stranded, or flexible power directly into “wild sats,” avoids point-of-purchase volatility, and can undercut exchange prices when energy is sourced efficiently (e.g., hydro in Paraguay/Ethiopia/Norway/Wisconsin). Halliburton frames mining as an upstream manufacturing process where energy becomes digital scarcity, predicts “sats per kWh” will rival “dollars per barrel,” and stresses that decentralizing rig ownership plus pool choice (e.g., Ocean integration) strengthens Bitcoin’s social and technical resilience. Saz’s mining-as-a-service model aligns incentives by charging only a 15% share of mined rewards, vetting long-term partners, diversifying jurisdictions, and focusing on Bitcoiners who want to accumulate BTC, not fiat returns, thereby repatriating value to local grids and turning excess capacity into export income while building a broader Bitcoiner-run hash base.\n\nBest Quotes\n-----------\n\n“I actually don’t see Bitcoin and energy as separate, they’re flip sides of the same coin.”\n\n“Mining is where reality hits Bitcoin.”\n\n“Most of the network’s centralization issues exist because Bitcoiners stopped mining and started buying.”\n\n“We only make money if you make Bitcoin.”\n\n“Sats per kilowatt-hour will become the new dollars per barrel.”\n\n“If every Bitcoiner visited a mine, they’d understand how real Bitcoin actually is.”\n\nConclusion\n----------\n\nMining anchors Bitcoin in physics, aligns operators with users, and decentralizes control of the network; by pairing low-cost renewable power with incentive-aligned operations and pool optionality, Saz’s approach shows how individuals can steadily accumulate BTC, strengthen grid and industry economics, and reduce central points of failure, pushing Bitcoin back into the hands of Bitcoiners while turning wasted energy into lasting monetary sovereignty.\n\nTranscript\n----------\n\n(00:04) Kent, thanks for coming to Austin. Excited to record this podcast, Center of Hash. I think we're at episode 10. We skipped a few weeks, but uh first how was your first CrossFit this morning? Oh, it was fun, man.  \n(00:23) It's been a lot of years since I've been in a gym and working out with a bunch of dudes like that. So, yeah, it was fun. Um, and I will be sore and not certain if I'm going to be able to uh put my bag in the overhead bin after all those uh presses. Guys and girls, we got a we've got a a Bitcoin group that goes to uh CrossFit a couple days a week.  \n(00:44) And um so both both represented, but you hadn't done it before and it was good to get you out there. Yeah. Good way to start the day. Yeah. Thank you. And it's fun to be here, man. I'm glad to be recording with you. And you were at you were at Tabcom just before this. Yeah, that was real the real uh um motivation to to get into the US.  \n(01:04) You know, I live abroad, but uh came came for Tabcom, you know, uh development and developers are a big part of our our business at SAS Mining and so uh came to to, you know, rub elbows with that community and learn what I could and then flew here to Austin afterwards to record with you. Quick shot over to Austin from Atlanta before going back to South America. Appreciate you you sliding through. Um, so you're founder and CEO co-founder co-founder. Yeah.  \n(01:28) And CEO of SAS mining, a Bitcoin mining company to set a baseline. Before we get into the mining business itself and how you guys approach it, explain a little bit about your background in energy and what led you to both Bitcoin and Bitcoin mining. start specifically with with your background just to give some of that color and context. Yeah.  \n(01:54) So, I I know everybody's got a unique path, right? I just think that mine is a little a wider weave than most uh to get here. So, I um did computer engineering in California. um actually did it on if you know who Bob Bernett is, CTO of Gateway Computers. I uh got a computer engineering degree on one of his computers that he designed which is very synchronous because he's now a an adviser for SAS mining and friend.  \n(02:22) Um but uh I did computer engineering and then I got quite passionate about solar rooftop solar specifically. And so from about 2008 until 2005 excuse me to 2014 I worked in that industry and um there's a lot of parallels to mining. I didn't realize it at the time obviously uh but in that industry you know I ran sales software and postacquisition integration for a publicly traded company where we had like nine figure revenue targets and the odd thing was at that point in time I was competing with like Elon Musk's cousins that he was helping to support. So those were kind of my primary competitors. But then the board of the  \n(03:02) the company I was working for, they decided to bring in a new CEO and I said, you know, I've always had a dream of seeing the world, so this seems like a good time to exit Sage Left. So I threw on a backpack and I traveled, took a couple years satical.  \n(03:18) And during that 2-year time frame between 2014 and 2016, I fell in love with the Portuguese woman and Bitcoin. So my life restarted in Portugal in 2016. What was first? The Portuguese woman or Bitcoin? Portuguese woman. Yeah. But it was uh oddly enough uh both happened in Peru and within uh about a year of each other. Yeah. So kind of kind of odd and I now live in Peru. Um but the the story for how I got to Peru is is uh is that I was in Portugal.  \n(03:46) Um tried my hand at all sorts of different Bitcoin entrepreneurial activities. Um, and ultimately after reading Jeff Booth's The Price of Tomorrow, there's a chapter on solar and Bitcoin mining. I was just like, \"Oh my gosh, what have I been doing? Let me figure out how to get into mining.  \n(04:03) \" And so had a mutual acquaintance uh from the solar industry that knew uh the founder of SAS Mining put us in touch and I joined up and helped the founder raise some capital and pivot the business into what we're now doing. Uh and then eventually the founder actually handed it off to me uh to to run the business. But during this time uh my wife and her work uh actually took us to Peru.  \n(04:25) So that's how I ended up in Peru since about 2021. We've been living there. At a top level, how do you think about solar energy in relation to Bitcoin? Bitcoin mining. Yeah, I think there's an inevitable collision that's going to happen there. Um and I don't think that all the technologies fully been worked out yet. And I think the magic piece of that is batteries.  \n(04:50) Um, as the cost curve of those come down, see the thing about solar that I think a lot of people miss in our industry is that it's very analogous to Bitcoin mining. Um, so it's decentralized, distributed, disruptive to the grid. You're importing it from China primarily and the infrastructure the infrastructure. Yeah.  \n(05:15) panels themselves come mainly from China and then your uh profits are constrained by an energy network. All of those characteristics are the same for mining. Now the cost curves for solar have come down faster than any other industry uh or energy source and you partner that with the fact that solar is the only way we can make electricity without moving anything means that the longevity of solar panels is incredible truly.  \n(05:39) Um I think it's an applicationspecific issue, but as uh solar integrates further and further into the the energy networks along with batteries, I think that Bitcoin mining is kind of the third leg of that stool that's really going to make that come alive in a big way. And I'm not I'm not as big a fan as like the industrial or the the mass uh solar farms as I am like use the real estate that's already on people's roofs.  \n(06:02) But at a certain point when solar gets cheap enough, which it is trending that direction, it's going to be pretty ubiquitous. I mean, you see China installing just incredible amounts of solar power right now, more than any other energy source. Before we get to Saz, you mentioned reading Jeff Booth the the price of tomorrow, having your background, if you could just discuss a little bit of that rabbit hole and your own kind of journey to Bitcoin at a more detail like what made it click for you and then um kind of your initial thinking and how that might have evolved from when that  \n(06:39) was. Oh man. So I I first bumped into Bitcoin in 2015 and this was uh during the time when I was on the sbatical and I was traveling and you know getting money in different countries was always just kind of a pain in the ass, right? And so as I uh as I just stumbled into, you know, I had free time.  \n(07:03) I was living in the sacred valley of Peru for a couple of months and I was just going down different rabbit holes and studying different things and I came across the white paper, read it, I was like, \"Oh, this is interesting. I'm going to go check it out and buy a little bit and play around with it.\" And just as a computer engineer realizing, \"Oh, I can transfer value all over the world and I don't have to be restricted in this way that I have been as I've traveled and trying to get money out of various ATMs. like this is incredible.  \n(07:26) So that was kind of the step one and then I got sucked into, you know, the the the shitcoin wheel of Samsara, right? That kind of fukes you out and you get to the other side, you know, purified and realizing that really I should be in Bitcoin, you know, I I did that for a couple years. Um but that process uh I I always came back to the signal that I was reading various books about Bitcoin itself and money and I think really you know that that fundamental question what is money uh came to the surface and as I studied that there's just several aha mom",

      "summary": "A new Fed report revealing $1.8T in hidden U.S. debt and China’s pivot to gold marks the beginning of the dollar’s decline.",
      "content": "Key Takeaways\n-------------\n\n![TFTC - New Data Shows the Dollar's 50-Year Run Is Ending (China Just Made Their Move) | Infranomics](https://www.tftc.io/content/images/2025/10/Infranomics.jpg)\n\nA new Fed analysis reveals the Cayman Islands, home to many hedge funds running the 50–100x-levered Treasury basis trade, actually hold about $1.8T in U.S. debt (far above prior estimates), spotlighting how dependent the Treasury market has become on repo-funded arbitrage; with the reverse repo drained, bank reserves falling, and SOFR spiking above the Fed’s corridor, funding stress risks a basis-trade unwind that would dump cash Treasuries (yields up) and bid futures, tightening liquidity into a credit wobble. At the same time, de-dollarization is accelerating: foreign governments now hold more gold than Treasuries, China keeps trimming its U.S. holdings while ramping gold via the Shanghai Gold Exchange and pushing yuan-settled trade, shifts that imply a gradual revaluation of FX crosses and a structurally weaker dollar. Domestically, debt math corners policymakers into “run it hot,” negative real rates and recurring deficits to inflate liabilities, while any real AI productivity gains arrive unevenly and could be deflationary for labor, likely inviting even more monetary expansion. In this landscape, gold and especially Bitcoin are the clearest hedges: gold is signaling stress now, but Bitcoin’s perfectly inelastic supply and self-custody make it the stronger, censorship-resistant savings technology as populism rises and institutions lose credibility.\n\nBest Quotes\n-----------\n\n“People need to really abstract out what the move in gold is actually signifying, once you get it, it’s red alert.”\n\n“Foreign governments now officially hold more gold in reserves than U.S. Treasuries.”\n\n“The largest marginal buyer of our debt is a bunch of 100-to-1 levered hedge funds in the basis trade.”\n\n“If you balanced the budget, it would result in a GDP contraction worse than 2008.”\n\n“The only thing I have high conviction in is Bitcoin.”\n\n“Come for number go up, stay for peer-to-peer digital cash that can’t be censored.”\n\nConclusion\n----------\n\nThe dollar’s 50-year run is fraying where it matters most: market plumbing and sovereign preference. Hidden leverage (basis trade), dwindling buffers (RRP, reserves), and funding spasms (SOFR) collide with an external pivot toward neutral reserves (gold) and yuan-linked settlement. Washington’s fiscal bind all but guarantees negative real rates and intermittent liquidity waves to keep the system afloat, policies that widen the K-shaped economy and erode purchasing power. Against that backdrop, gold’s breakout is the siren; Bitcoin is the lifeboat: a scarce, bearer, self-custodied asset outside the policy machine, built for a multipolar world where trust migrates from institutions to protocols.\n\nTimestamps\n----------\n\n0:00 - Intro  \n1:03 - Explaining the basis trade  \n10:55 - Liquidity crunch  \n17:44 - Bitkey & Obscura  \n19:28 - Debt ceiling and BRICS  \n31:09 - China has the leverage  \n36:51 - Generational gap  \n42:17 - SLNT & Unchained  \n43:46 - Trump’s domestic policy  \n48:18 - Melt up, gold safe haven  \n59:02 - AI miracle  \n1:06:53 - Bitcoin pulling back  \n1:16:16 - Freedom money & populism\n\nTranscript\n----------\n\n(00:00) People need to really kind of abstract out how to think of what the move in gold is actually signifying because once you get it, it's red alert. If you bounce the budget, it would result in a GDP contraction worse than 2008. You have the reverse repo empty. Bank reserves are declining.  \n(00:17) The largest marginal buyer of our debt is a bunch of 100 to1 levered hedge funds in this basis trade. The Cayman Islands actually hold $1.8 trillion of our debt underount by $1.4 trillion. Foreign governments now officially hold more gold in reserves than US treasuries. China held about 784 billion. Just in 5 months from February to now that's down to 730 billion. That's significant.  \n(00:36) What you could get is a revaluation of some of these currency crosses. I don't understand how anyone could argue that China is not the one with the leverage. I mean, we lost effectively a proxy war to a country with 11 12th of our GDP. You end up talking about like a $5 trillion deficit in just a normal recession. They're trying to thread a needle here.  \n(00:54) I don't know if it's going to work. The only thing that I have high conviction in is Bitcoin. Robert, welcome back to the show, sir. Good to be back. Good to have you back. I've been uh binging your your YouTube channel the last two weeks. was telling you before that I was checking in once a week, but I think with all the madness going on in markets right now, uh you've been covering everything going on uh with great detail, it's astonishing the uh the amount of detail that you can go into and the the amount of data that  \n(01:32) you're able to surface. I reached out last week. I said, \"Hey, would love to catch you up on the show. Last time you were on, we talked about silent depression and sort of the more secular headwinds, if you will, society in terms of the the effect that the economy is having on on individuals and society at large in aggregate.  \n(01:56) And I think we definitely touch on that later because I think things are certainly accelerating as AI becomes more prominent and people begin to worry about what the job market is going to look like moving forward. But I think just to stay timely and topical, you've you've been covering um a Fed report that was dropped I believe over the weekend that highlights the dynamics of the the Treasury market are are not what they were being reported and it all stems from activity going on in the Cayman Islands particularly around the basis trade. So what uh what did the Fed just let the markets know?  \n(02:36) Yeah. So apparently um we had suspected according to the tick data which is uh released by the treasury department it's basically the official data on who holds US government debt uh and general crossborder capital flows that tick data had reported that our holders the holders of our debt were Japan at about 1.  \n(03:06) 1 trillion UK at about 900 billion China at about 700 billion and that that that has been coming down pretty notably. Uh and then the Cayman Islands as our fourth largest holder at about 400 billion. Uh but because of this popular hedge fund trade known as the basis trade, the Cayman Islands, obviously a hot spot for uh hedge funds doiciled in the Cayman Islands. This has nothing to do with like the Cayman government.  \n(03:30) When we're talking about the Cayman Islands, uh we're talking really about the fact that there's so many hedge funds uh based there, doiciled there. The Cayman Islands actually hold $1.8 trillion of our debt. Um and so that makes them by far the largest holder of US government debt. And before it was being reported that they held what around 400 400. Yeah. 400.  \n(03:54) So So underount by $1.4 trillion. So, what what I'm trying to understand is why wasn't this reported correctly before the Fed released this report? Why did the Fed decide to let everybody know, oh well, actually here's what's going on.  \n(04:18) Yeah, that second question is one kind of the first one that popped into my head after I realized the implication of this. Uh, my first question is, okay, well, why now? Um so it has to do with like how they calculate uh the repo uh because this basis trade is financed in the repo market uh which makes sofur and what's going on there I think uh pretty important um but it has to do with just the way the methodology with which they use to measure um various crossber capital flows. Yeah.  \n(04:52) And so for anybody who's listening who may need a refresher on the basis trade here, what are hedge funds doing when they engage in this? Yeah. So the basis trade is treasury futures. Let's just use a 10-year Treasury. There's the cash 10-year Treasury, which most people are familiar with, but then there is a futures contract that represents a 10-year Treasury.  \n(05:15) That 10-year Treasury futures contract is obviously a contract for future delivery. Um, but there is this optionality that the seller has when you sell a 10-year Treasury futures contract. There's optionality there where you get to actually deliver. You don't have to deliver a 10-year Treasury at the end. You can deliver uh 6 and 1/2 year maturity, 7-year. There's a range.  \n(05:40) And so the seller gets to choose the cheapest option for them. Uh maybe at the time, you know, it's a 10 basis point difference uh between the seven and the 10. So they deliver the seven even though it's a 10-year Treasury contract. Um and that kind of optionality or uncertainty premium is baked into the futures contract. So uh it's very small. It's only about 10 basis points or 0.1%. So that trades at a premium, the future.  \n(06:07) And so what they do is they short the futures contract and then they buy they long the underlying US cash treasury. Um and the difference as expiration near uh treasury features ex you know kind of roll expire every 3 months as you near to expiration that uh that difference as the arbitrage kind of gets gets worked out uh goes to zero.  \n(06:36) And so you're basically just pocketing the spread between the futures contract and the 10-year Tre the actual 10-year Treasury. And so it's delta neutral cuz if uh if bond yields go up, well, you're you're covered because you're you're short the 10-year futures contract. Bond yields go down, you're okay because you're long the cash um the cash uh 10ear treasury.  \n(07:00) So it's delta neutral meaning um and also it's it's using probably I mean what at least what the market considers to be pristine collateral um we you know have different opinion on that but um but yeah that so so the fact that it is using US treasuries as the collateral for financing in the repo market makes it um less risky uh and of course you're you're delta",

A circle of Hell that many societies have found themselves in the past. The money is broken and the negative externalities emanating from the rotten core of our global economy have produced a degenerate high velocity trash economy. We've discussed the nature of the high velocity trash economy in this rag many times throughout the years, but it feels like every day it stoops to a new low. I fear that peak clown world is nowhere in sight.\n\nNothing makes this more clear than the fact that Bloomberg, a supposed legitimate media organization, decided to host he CEO of OnlyFans, Kelly Blair, for a fireside chat to boast about the profitability of the highly controversial platform since 2016. According to Blair, OnlyFans paid out \"creators\" more than $25B since 2016. She stated this with a sense of pride that would lead many to think that they should believe that OnlyFans is doing something virtuous. Something to be proud about.\n\nNothing could be further from the truth. OnlyFans, and other platforms like it, are not only a stain on society, but a sign that things have gone terribly awry.\n\nThis newsletter is hard to write because I try as hard as possible not to come off as some pompous prick who thinks they know better than anyone else. If you've been reading this rag long enough, you'll know that this most certainly is not true. However, I feel viscerally compelled to speak out against displays of overt hubris and nonchalant comfort-ability in matters of pure degeneracy. And this is most certainly one of the more hubristic displays of degenerate pride that I simply cannot let slip by.\n\nThe fact that Bloomberg, a media organization that carries a perception (at least in my view) of a purveyor of financial signal that rises above the fray of click-bait hell, would invite the CEO of OnlyFans on stage to brag about the money it has made off of the backs of women (and men) who have decided to cater to their most degenerate impulses is truly appalling.\n\nCall me a prude.\n\nCall me a curmudgeon.\n\nCall me a pompous prick.\n\nI don't care.\n\nThere's nothing you can call me that will convince me that this display of degenerate celebration isn't deeply wrong. The fact that OnlyFans is one of the most profitable companies in the world on a profit-per-employee basis despite the fact that they have paid out \"creators\" $25b since 2016 is an objective red flag that should cause anyone with a soul to take pause.\n\nFirst off, the $25b stat is extremely misleading. OnlyFans payouts work on a hyper-pareto distribution that favors the top 0.1% of \"creators\" on their platform. The \"fortunate\" few in that top 0.1% openly flaunt the millions of dollars they have been able to bring in to the unsuspecting mass of young women who come to the idiotic emotional conclusion that they too can attain the same status by creating an account and offering themselves to the world of digital hornballs sitting on the other side of the app looking to get a good fap in.\n\nWhich brings us to the other side of this coin; the young and old men who have been deduced to seek out quick pleasure when their PornHub dopamine receptors run dry by downloading OnlyFans and trying to reignite their receptors by finding the next girl next door. This is a two-sided market and one side of the market is providing the incentive for young women to objectify themselves.\n\nThis part of our society is sick. Utterly and unequivocally sick.\n\nAnd it's nothing new. Women turning to sex work when economic times take a turn for the worse is nothing new. It was true in Ancient Rome. It was true during the decay of the Weimar Republic. It was true during the lead up to World War II in South East Asia. And it is true today.\n\nAgain, I want to avoid coming off as a pompous know-it-all, but fuck it. This all, at its core, stems from broken money whether people realize it or not.\n\nWhen money breaks, people reduce themselves to their lowest common denominator in an attempt to survive. And in a world occupied by humans with decaying structure, the lowest common denominator is sexual desire. Pure animalistic domination and validation.\n\nThe fact the Bloomberg invited the CEO of OnlyFans on stage to discuss her company's \"success\" is either a sign of subversion or submission. Regardless of what Bloomberg's intentions were when they decided to host and post the fireside chat with Kelly Blair do not matter. The deed has been done. The normalization and idolization of succumbing to our lowest common denominator is well underway.\n\nIf you care about the future of our children, you should call this degeneracy out and ridicule it as vehemently as possible. It is the manifestation of the most animalistic and unhinged form of the high velocity trash economy, And, whether you recognize it or not, the tides will not turn until we fix the money.\n\nDignity stems from the ability to have agency over your own life. How much agency can you have over your life if a very select few individuals can decide on a whim to devalue the money you store the fruits of your labor in?\n\n* * *\n\n### The Cayman Islands Is Actually America's Largest Creditor\n\nRobert revealed a startling discovery from a recent Fed report that fundamentally changes our understanding of who holds U.S. Treasury debt. The Treasury Department's TIC data had long reported the Cayman Islands as our fourth-largest creditor at roughly $400 billion. However, the Fed's new analysis shows the actual figure is $1.8 trillion—making the Cayman Islands the largest holder of U.S. government debt by far, surpassing traditional holders like Japan, the UK, and China.\n\n> \"The Cayman Islands actually hold $1.8 trillion of our debt, and so that makes them by far the largest holder of U.S. government debt.\"- [Robert (Infraa)](https://x.com/infraa_?ref=tftc.io)\n\nRobert explained that this massive undercount of $1.4 trillion stems from the methodology used to measure cross-border capital flows and repo market activity. The discrepancy is tied directly to hedge funds domiciled in the Cayman Islands engaging in the basis trade—a leveraged arbitrage strategy we'll explore further. The critical question Robert raised: why did the Fed choose to reveal this information now?\n\nCheck out the [full podcast here](https://youtu.be/j_VA2wcyRxE?ref=tftc.io) for more on the basis trade mechanics, SOFR market stress signals, and populism's impact on assets.\n\n* * *\n\n### Headlines of the Day\n\n[Hong Kong Approves Spot Solana ETF](https://x.com/WatcherGuru/status/1980895010955690266?ref=tftc.io)\n\n[BlackRock Bitcoin ETP Launches on LSE](https://x.com/TFTC21/status/1980726085768925322?ref=tftc.io)\n\n[Waller Calls Bitcoin Electronic Gold](https://x.com/BitcoinMagazine/status/1980742537724760369?ref=tftc.io)\n\n[Fidelity Says Bitcoin Central to Clients](https://x.com/BitcoinMagazine/status/1980933079742153207?ref=tftc.io)\n\n[German Fintech Adopts Bitcoin Treasury](https://x.com/TFTC21/status/1980698306595746039?ref=tftc.io)\n\n[Coinbase CEO Heads to DC on Crypto](https://x.com/BitcoinMagazine/status/1980960389740298596?ref=tftc.io)\n\n* * *\n\n[![A New Low For The High Velocity Trash Economy](https://www.tftc.io/content/images/2025/10/D1-1.png)](http://unchnd.co/46Mnnpx?ref=tftc.io)\n\n[Register Now](http://unchnd.co/46Mnnpx?ref=tftc.io)\n\nIs the fiat retirement system sinking?

      "content": "Marty's Bent\n------------\n\n[![A More Private Way To Do Collaborative Custody](https://www.tftc.io/content/images/2025/10/Screenshot-2025-10-24-at-9.04.26---AM.png)](https://bitkey.build/chain-code-delegation-improving-privacy-in-collaborative-multisig/?ref=tftc.io)\n\nvia [Bitkey](https://bitkey.build/chain-code-delegation-improving-privacy-in-collaborative-multisig/?ref=tftc.io)\n\n![A More Private Way To Do Collaborative Custody](https://www.tftc.io/content/images/2025/10/martybent_a_man_signing_a_private_bitcoin_transaction_from_his__3ac4c88a-dff9-466a-9db6-e3cf0faebed3.png)\n\nYesterday Bitkey submitted a Bitcoin Improvement Proposal (BIP) for \"Chain Code Delegation\", which would significantly improve the privacy of bitcoin users who utilize collaborative multisig set ups. For those who are unaware of collaborative multisig setups, the concept is that, as a user, you can increase the robustness and resiliency of your multisig wallet by adding a collaborative custody partner to the multisig quorum. This is the model that companies like Bitkey, Unchained offer their clients.\n\nIt's a great tradeoff because it provides individuals who find the responsibility of holding their bitcoin in a single signature address and securing the wallet and back up properly too daunting. With collaborative multisig you are able to maintain unilateral control over your bitcoin with a fall back option to have your custody partner help you if you're in a pinch because you only have access to one wallet or you lost a wallet and its back up. But, to date, it's been a tradeoff that comes with a privacy leak. Your collaborative custody partner knows exactly how much bitcoin you have in the public address associated with the multisig quorum at all times. This is because of the way multisig wallets are typically created on the application layer. All parties participating in a multisig quorum currently need to share a lot of information about the wallet, particularly the xpub.\n\nWith Chain Code Delegation, this will no longer be the case. Users can reap the benefits of collaborative custody without having to disclose their public addresses and balances. The only time they would reveal a balance to their collaborative custody partner is if that cosigner is needed to sign a transaction. And even then, they would only know about the individual UTXOs included in the transaction.\n\nThis is a massive boon to privacy and it is incredible to see the Bitkey team leading the charge. Shout out to everyone on the Bitkey team who worked on this and Jesse Posner (formerly with Bitkey). It will be cool to see this in the wild.\n\nThis is particularly exciting because, as I mentioned earlier, this type of \"upgrade\" is isolated to the application layer. There is no need to make a consensus or policy change to bitcoin. It's simply a new standard for creating multisig wallets.\n\n* * *\n\n### The Basis Trade Represents a Significant Systemic Risk\n\nRobert from Infranomics broke down a ticking time bomb in the Treasury market that regulators have been watching for years. The basis trade, where hedge funds short Treasury futures while going long on cash Treasuries, might seem innocuous at first glance. After all, it's just capturing a tiny 0.1% arbitrage spread. But here's where it gets dangerous: funds are leveraging this trade anywhere from 50:1 to as high as 100:1, turning a small edge into meaningful profits while creating massive systemic risk.\n\n> \"This is well documented. If you Google, this has been an issue for years. This has been a risk that the Fed has known about.\"- [Robert (Infraa)](https://x.com/infraa_?ref=tftc.io)\n\nRobert pointed to the 2020 blowup and the April \"Liberation Day\" incident as proof this trade can unravel violently. The Brookings Institute even published warnings in June. When SOFR spiked to 0.19% last week, the highest since 2020, it signaled fresh stress in the repo market financing all this leverage. The Fed, SEC, and CFTC know the risks. The question is what happens when it blows up again.\n\nCheck out the [full podcast here](https://youtu.be/j_VA2wcyRxE?ref=tftc.io) for more on the Cayman Islands Treasury revelation, populism's impact on assets, and why Bitcoin matters now.\n\n* * *\n\n### Headlines of the Day\n\n[Crypto Firms Donate to Trump Ballroom](https://x.com/WatcherGuru/status/1981503515651690530?ref=tftc.io)\n\n[Bitcoin Poised to Surge per Gold Lag Trend](https://x.com/BitcoinNewsCom/status/1981481711033565499?ref=tftc.io)\n\n[Strive Exec Details Bitcoin Treasury Firms](https://x.com/TFTC21/status/1981478218554355871?ref=tftc.io)\n\n[Binance Takes $2B Trump-Linked Stablecoin](https://x.com/TFTC21/status/1981466076438548939?ref=tftc.io)  \n  \n[Trump Says CZ Pardon Not for a Crime](https://x.com/BitcoinNewsCom/status/1981463899292783004?ref=tftc.io)\n\n* * *\n\n[![A More Private Way To Do Collaborative Custody](https://www.tftc.io/content/images/2025/10/D1-1.png)](http://unchnd.co/46Mnnpx?ref=tftc.io)\n\n[Register Now](http://unchnd.co/46Mnnpx?ref=tftc.io)\n\nIs the fiat retirement system sinking?

      "content": "**_Authorities seek to balance investors’ right to restitution with the State’s fiscal interests._**\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n[According](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-10-15/uk-seeks-to-pay-back-chinese-investors-swindled-in-6-8-billion-bitcoin-fraud) to _Bloomberg_, during a hearing at the **High Court of London**, British authorities announced their intention to establish a **compensation** **scheme** for victims of a fraud orchestrated by Chinese investors, while simultaneously aiming to retain most of the bitcoins seized in 2018. The case involves **61,000 bitcoins**, currently valued at **$6.8 billion**, representing one of the largest digital asset seizures in UK history.\n\nDuring the October 15 hearing, the **Director of Public Prosecutions** outlined to the victims’ representatives the possibility of setting up such a mechanism, although specific details of how the compensation program will operate remain confidential. The initiative represents an attempt by British authorities to balance the right to compensation for **128,000** affected Chinese investors with the fiscal interests of the State.\n\nThe victims of the fraud argue that the UK government should not profit from their financial losses. The controversy is heightened by the fact that the value of bitcoins has risen from **$1.8 billion** at the time of the seizure in 2018 to the current **$6.8 billion**.\n\n### **Origins of the fraud**\n\nThe fraud was orchestrated by **Zhimin Qian**, a 47-year-old woman also known as **Yadi Zhang**, who ran a fraudulent scheme in China from 2014 to 2017. The system caused losses to victims totaling **43 billion yuan**, roughly $6 billion. Its structure was similar to a Ponzi-style scam.\n\nAfter converting much of investors’ money into bitcoin, Qian fled China and settled in the UK under a false identity. Together with her Malaysian associate **Seng Hok Ling**, she confessed to money laundering at the **Southwark Crown Court** in London last month. Both will face sentencing in November.\n\nDuring the seizure operation, investigators recovered computer assets containing **61,000 bitcoins** from a villa in **Hampstead**, north London. Authorities later gained access to additional digital assets worth approximately **£67 million** after Qian disclosed access codes and passwords for a Ledger device and two wallets. _“The Ledger was found in a purpose-made concealed pocket within a pair of jogging bottoms that \\[Zhang\\] was wearing at the time of her arrest,”_ according to written submissions by **Martin Evans KC**, lawyer for the **Crown Prosecution Service**.\n\n### **The victims’ position**\n\nDespite the announcement of the proposed compensation, lawyers representing the victims face several obstacles in the restitution process. One difficulty lies in establishing direct connections between the victims’ initial investments and the bitcoins seized by authorities.\n\n**Jack Ding**, assistant managing partner at the law firm **Duan & Duan**, representing approximately **10,000** victims, noted that _“some materials lack sufficient information to establish a clear connection.”_ Legal experts warn that victims are unlikely to recover the appreciated value of the bitcoins, as courts normally focus on returning the principal amount plus reasonable interest, rather than speculative gains from asset appreciation.\n\n**William Glover**, director of the law firm **Fieldfisher**, representing a group of victims, said after the hearing that _“the Director of Public Prosecutions has effectively accepted responsibility to create a form of compensation scheme for those who may be unable to seek redress through the existing statutory provisions.”_\n\n_“Given the unprecedented scale of the seizure and public debate about any potential surplus, our position is clear: victims’ restitution must come first,”_ told _Bloomberg_ **Jackson Ng**, a lawyer representing a set of investors.\n\nAccording to some government officials, the bitcoins will likely be subject to prolonged legal disputes, potentially extending until 2027.\n\nThe post [UK proposes compensation for Chinese victims of $6.8B BTC fraud](https://atlas21.com/uk-proposes-compensation-for-chinese-victims-of-6-8b-btc-fraud/) appeared first on [Atlas21](https://atlas21.com).",

Which of the two halves will you naturally be incentivized to spend first? The answer is obvious: the one that is depreciating, namely fiat currency. The reasoning seems logical: spending bitcoin would mean giving up potential future gains. However, there is a paradox in this choice. **That potential gain is already being lost with all the fiat money you continue to hold**. If that 50% of your wealth were also in bitcoin, you would already be fully exposed to all possible upside. At that point, the only real sacrifice would be limited to what you spend on your daily necessities. In other words, every time you choose to spend fiat currency while saving your bitcoins, you are effectively taking a precise market position: you are **short** on bitcoin and **long** on fiat.\n\nThere is a paradox that lurks in the Bitcoin community, and it particularly affects the so-called “Saylor Bros” – those who have made **HODL** a religion. While they preach unlimited accumulation and criticize those who dare to spend their satoshis, they find themselves with bank accounts full of euros or dollars that depreciate day after day. The result? Every euro or dollar not converted into bitcoin is betting that **Christine Lagarde** (ECB) and **Jerome Powell** (Fed) are more reliable than an immutable mathematical algorithm.\n\n### **The numbers don’t lie**\n\nBitcoin’s price volatility is at multi-year historic lows and shows a long-term downward trend, signaling a deeper and more mature market compared to past cycles, also thanks to greater institutional participation and the liquidity of listed instruments. According to an [analysis](https://research.kaiko.com/insights/bitcoin-booms-in-low-risk-environment) by **Kaiko Research**, BTC’s 30-day realized volatility is currently below **40%,** lower than the average of 51% since January 2022. Since the launch of spot ETFs, 30-day realized volatility has not exceeded **80%** and dropped to **25%** in June 2024.\n\n![](https://i0.wp.com/atlas21.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Screenshot-2025-07-14-at-16.12.45-1.png?resize=1024%2C547&ssl=1)\n\nAccording to a 2024 **Fidelity** [report](https://www.fidelitydigitalassets.com/research-and-insights/closer-look-bitcoins-volatility#bitcoin-can-be-less-volatile-than-many-large-and-popular-securities), through the end of 2023, there were 92 S&P 500 stocks more volatile than bitcoin’s price. For the asset management firm, as the asset matures and its total market capitalization grows, capital inflow is expected to have less impact on price.\n\nConversely, the U.S. **M2** money supply has recorded a structural jump after 2020: from $15 trillion pre-pandemic to **over $22 trillion** in 2025 according to [official Federal Reserve data](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/M2SL), with new highs reached during 2025, testifying to the monetary expansion following pandemic quantitative easing.\n\nIn parallel, inflation has reached multi-decade peaks: in the Euro area, the HICP (Harmonized Index of Consumer Prices) [reached](https://tradingeconomics.com/euro-area/inflation-cpi) **10.6%** in October 2022 before returning toward 2-3% in 2025; similar dynamics were observed in the **United States**, with a strong inflationary impulse in 2021-2022 and subsequent decline, but with permanently higher price levels.\n\nFaced with these numbers, continuing to maintain a substantial portion of one’s wealth in fiat currency is **not prudence, it is a bet**. A bet that central banks will manage the money supply better than a mathematical protocol with fixed, immutable, and verifiable issuance.\n\n### **The paradox of absolute HODL**\n\n**Michael Saylor** has transformed **Strategy** (formerly MicroStrategy) into a bitcoin investment vehicle, advocating relentless accumulation. A brilliant strategy for a company that has access to capital markets and can issue debt or shares to acquire additional fiat currency to convert into bitcoin. But any private individual does not have these tools. If one truly applied Saylor’s strategy logic to its fullest extent, an individual would end up with **100% of their wealth in bitcoin**. And at that point, they would inevitably be forced to spend it to live.\n\nWould that really be a problem? If the goal is to maximize exposure to bitcoin, why should one maintain thousands of euros in a checking account? Every day that passes, that liquidity loses purchasing power. The truth is that **if you have enough fiat currency to be able to choose what to spend, then you have too much fiat currency**. The correct mantra should not be _“keep in bitcoin only what you’re willing to lose,”_ but its opposite: _“Keep in fiat currency only what you can afford to lose.”_\n\n### **Spending bitcoin without friction**\n\nThe classic objection regarding spending bitcoin has always been: “But do you have to convert bitcoin to euros to pay for goods and services, wasting time and paying fees?” This objection no longer holds today.\n\nServices like **Bull Bitcoin** have created infrastructures that allow you to spend bitcoin directly without having to convert it manually. The Canadian broker allows you to make euro transfers using your satoshis directly, making it possible to pay suppliers, public entities, companies, and top up debit cards linked to IBANs.\n\nThe technological solution exists, it works, and it is available today. The problem is no longer technical, it is mental.\n\n### **The real OGs spend bitcoin**\n\nThe true pioneers of bitcoin, those who used it when it was worth a few dollars or even when it was worth nothing, spent it. **Laszlo Hanyecz** bought two pizzas with **10,000 BTC** not because he was stupid, but because he believed in a usable monetary system and had wealth far exceeding that amount.\n\nBitcoin was born as _“A Peer-to-Peer Electronic Cash System,”_ not as _“A Digital Asset to HODL Forever While Keeping Your Life Savings in Depreciating Fiat.”_ If someone’s strategy is to accumulate bitcoin indefinitely without ever using it, they are implicitly declaring that something else (fiat currency) has more monetary utility.\n\nThe choice is not between spending everything or spending nothing. The choice is **which currency to expose yourself to**.\n\n* * *\n\n_Bull Bitcoin is the world’s longest-running Bitcoin-only exchange. Strictly non-custodial.

      "content": "**_The BoE intends to temporarily maintain limits on stablecoin holdings to safeguard the UK’s financial system._**\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nThe **Bank of England** clarified that the restrictions on stablecoins are a transitional solution, not a permanent stance. [Speaking](https://www.bankofengland.co.uk/speech/2025/october/sarah-breeden-panellist-at-fintech-foundation-2025-dc-fiintech-week) at the **DC Fintech** **Week** conference, Deputy Governor **Sarah Breeden** reiterated that the central bank aims to remove these limits once the financial system has fully adapted to these new payment instruments.\n\nThe restrictions were first proposed in a discussion [paper](https://www.bankofengland.co.uk/paper/2023/dp/regulatory-regime-for-systemic-payment-systems-using-stablecoins-and-related-service-providers) published in November 2023, designed to protect the stability of the UK’s financial system. The proposal drew criticism from industry groups last September, who argued that the limits would stifle innovation and harm the UK’s reputation as a digital-friendly jurisdiction.\n\nThe central bank’s main goal is to allow the _“real economy to gradually adapt”_ to the integration of stablecoins, while continuously monitoring adoption and assessing potential risks from rapid shifts in the financial system’s structure. Breeden stressed that the limits are a **temporary mechanism**:\n\n> > “I want to be very clear. We expect to remove the limits on stablecoins once we can verify that the transition no longer poses a threat to the provision of financing to the real economy.”\n\nThe Bank of England’s main concern is that rapid and large-scale transfers of funds from traditional bank accounts into stablecoins could lead to _“a sharp reduction in lending to businesses and households.”_ Setting caps on how much stablecoin a single user can hold has been identified as the most effective way to prevent a dangerous contraction in credit access for UK borrowers.\n\nThe post [Bank of England: stablecoin limits are a temporary measure](https://atlas21.com/bank-of-england-stablecoin-limits-are-a-temporary-measure/) appeared first on [Atlas21](https://atlas21.com).",

Supporters argue that integrating bitcoin would enable instant, global transfers without the need for banks, intermediaries, or extra apps.\n\n### **The benefits of bitcoin on Signal**\n\nThe campaign website reads: _“Bitcoin belongs in Signal. Cashu ecash enables truly private BTC payments inside the world’s most trusted encryption messenger.”_ Supporters also highlight that Bitcoin could help the service achieve financial independence, as Signal currently relies on donations and external funding.\n\nWith Bitcoin payments on Signal, users could send small donations or tips directly within the app to help keep Signal free and open source.\n\nOther prominent figures in the community have also voiced their support, including developer **Peter Todd** and Satoshi Labs co-founder **Pavol Rusnak.**\n\nPeter Todd [also criticized](https://x.com/peterktodd/status/1978887797285990676) Signal’s current payment option, **MobileCoin** (MOB), stating:\n\n> > “I’ve been wanting to try MobileCoin. But it’s such a failure I can’t even buy any. Signal App needs to accept reality and just add Bitcoin support.”\n\nThe encrypted messaging service tested MobileCoin in April 2021 to explore the possibility of private transfers through the app. Over time, however, users and experts have identified multiple issues with the system. Critics also point out that MobileCoin is hard to buy or use in most countries, as it’s not available on many exchanges.\n\nThe app currently has around **70 million** monthly active users. Analysts believe that if even a small percentage of them started sending bitcoin through the app, Signal could become one of the largest platforms for private peer-to-peer transactions.\n\nThe post [Bitcoin for Signal: the campaign to integrate BTC into the messaging app](https://atlas21.com/bitcoin-for-signal-the-campaign-to-integrate-btc-into-the-messaging-app/) appeared first on [Atlas21](https://atlas21.com).",

The event reviewed the implementations currently operational on the Lightning, RGB, and Taproot Assets protocols.\n\nThe **RGB Protocol Association** confirmed that RGB v0.11.1 is active on mainnet. The protocol enables the issuance of assets, including stablecoins and tokens, through smart contracts that operate with a privacy-oriented approach. Integration with the Lightning Network represents one of the ongoing technical developments.\n\n**Darius**, co-founder of Lnfi Network, presented **LN Node**, a self-custodial Lightning node with support for Bitcoin, Taproot Assets, and RGB. This solution allows operators to open channels, generate yields in BTC, and manage assets through a web interface or natural language commands.\n\nOn the front of native yield in bitcoin, **Federico Tenga**, R&D strategist at Bitfinex, discussed the use of Lightning to generate yields through liquidity routing, without resorting to centralized staking or lending.\n\nThe presentation by **Walter Maffione**, co-founder and CTO of KaleidoSwap, showcased the first atomic swap of RGB assets executed on the Lightning Network. The operation was performed using the DEX infrastructure developed by KaleidoSwap, enabling trustless exchanges between RGB assets on mainnet.\n\n**Bobby Shell**, VP Marketing at Voltage, illustrated some new use cases in development for the Lightning Network: micropayments for AI services, stablecoin invoicing, and pay-per-use APIs.\n\nDuring the panels, the transitional phase that the ecosystem is going through emerged: while on one hand various layer 2 components – including trading protocols, programmable applications, and self-custodial yield mechanisms – are already operational on mainnet, on the other hand the need to improve user experience and accessibility for developers and end users remains a priority.\n\nThe post [Lightning2049: Bitcoin layer 2 comparison in Singapore](https://atlas21.com/lightning2049-bitcoin-layer-2-comparison-in-singapore/) appeared first on [Atlas21](https://atlas21.com).",

Now available on both **iOS** and **Android**, the wallet focuses on privacy, security and ease of use.\n\n**Francis Pouliot**, founder and CEO of Bull Bitcoin, stated:\n\n_“BULL is Bitcoin-only, fully open-source, and built to prioritize privacy, security and simplicity. This is only the beginning: we will keep improving it forever.”_\n\nAmong the technical features, the application adopts a descriptor-based Segwit-native architecture and uses the **BDK** (Bitcoin Dev Kit) library. The wallet supports BIP39 seed phrases and allows connection to full-nodes or Electrum servers.\n\nAdditional functionalities include manual UTXO management, the Replace-by-Fee (RBF) option and testnet compatibility. The source code is publicly available.\n\n### **Focus on privacy**\n\nThe application does not collect user data, does not send push notifications and does not track IP addresses. It also supports the **Payjoin** protocol. The wallet also introduces **BIP85**\\-based secret derivation and confidential transactions via the **Liquid** sidechain.\n\n### **Multi-chain and atomic swap**\n\nBULL Wallet operates on three networks: the Bitcoin mainnet, the Lightning network and Liquid. Using non-custodial **atomic swap** technologies based on **Boltz**, users can transfer funds between the three networks.\n\nFor Lightning payments, the wallet offers a user experience without the need to manage channels or liquidity. Small payments received on the Liquid network are automatically converted to bitcoin once a customizable threshold is reached, set by default at **0.01 BTC**.\n\n### **Integration with exchange and hardware wallet**\n\nFor Android users, BULL Wallet offers optional integration with the Bull Bitcoin broker, allowing purchases, sales and payments directly from the wallet.\n\nThe wallet can also be used together with a hardware wallet: initially it will be compatible with **Coldcard Q1,** with integrations planned for other devices.\n\n### **Backup and future roadmap**\n\nAt launch, **Recoverbull** is included, a new backup solution for hot wallets.\n\nThe company has outlined a roadmap that includes integration of the **Ark** network, support for **Silent Payments**, secure and anonymous metadata backup, full support of all major hardware wallets, multi-sig wallet and **Miniscript** integration, **Nostr-based** anonymous chat and **Lightning Network** addresses.\n\nThe post [Bull Bitcoin launches BULL Wallet on iOS](https://atlas21.com/bull-bitcoin-launches-bull-wallet-on-ios/) appeared first on [Atlas21](https://atlas21.com).",

This move would aim to simplify crypto market access for retail investors.\n\nThe proposal under discussion includes the creation of specific regulatory safeguards designed to mitigate financial risks linked to the potential regulatory update. The issue will be addressed in an upcoming meeting of the **Financial Services Council**, an advisory body to the Prime Minister.\n\nIn parallel with this opening, Japan’s Financial Services Agency is stepping up its efforts to ensure the integrity of the digital asset market. According to reports, the FSA is preparing to introduce regulatory amendments that would explicitly ban trading based on non-public information.

Priced at **€249**, the device brings several innovations compared to previous models. The Safe 7 is fully wireless thanks to **Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE)** connectivity, allowing it to connect to any device, including **iOS** devices. Charging is enabled via **Qi2 wireless technology**, eliminating the need for cables.\n\nThe wallet features a **2.5-inch** color touchscreen, offering a **62%** larger display area compared to the previous model. The casing combines aluminum and glass, and the device is dust- and water-resistant.\n\nRegarding power, Trezor opted for a **330mAh LiFePO4 battery**, which, according to the company, delivers four times the recharge cycles of standard batteries and can safely discharge down to 0% without damage.\n\nA central element of the new product is the **TROPIC01 secure chip**, built on an **open-source architecture**. Another key feature is its “quantum-ready” protection: both the bootloader and authenticity verification systems use post-quantum algorithms, the company stated. Alongside the TROPIC01 chip, the device also includes a second EAL6+ certified secure element that is NDA-free.\n\n![](https://i0.wp.com/atlas21.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/G3xXt1QWsAAZhnS-1.jpeg?resize=1024%2C768&ssl=1)\n\n_Source: [X](https://x.com/OhHaiAndy/status/1980554386268123491)_\n\nDuring the presentation, the team acknowledged that quantum computing remains a concept poorly understood by most people but pointed out that the Bitcoin protocol currently lacks dedicated protections against such potential future threats, while the Safe 7 is already prepared for them, Trezor emphasized. The device supports “quantum-secure” updates, meaning that when quantum computers become a real-world threat, there will be no need to replace the hardware: Trezor Safe 7 can be securely updated to maintain user protection.\n\n**Danny Sanders**, Chief Operating Officer at Trezor, described the new device as _“the complete solution in self-custody.”_ Alongside the launch, the company also revamped and rebranded its software as **Trezor Suite**, which enables users to connect with external wallets and applications to manage and exchange their assets.\n\nThe post [Trezor unveils Safe 7: a “quantum-ready” hardware wallet with open-source chip](https://atlas21.com/trezor-unveils-safe-7-a-quantum-ready-hardware-wallet-with-open-source-chip/) appeared first on [Atlas21](https://atlas21.com).",

      "content": "**_At the PoW Space in Lugano, Ark Labs announced the launch of Arkade, an open-source platform for programmable applications and financial services on Bitcoin._**\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nOn October 21st, the “**Arkade activation day**” event, hosted in Lugano at **PoW Space**, brought together developers and industry figures for the official presentation of the platform. **Arkade** aims to bring Bitcoin toward the concept of “programmable money” without compromising the principles of self-custody and security.\n\n> ![💥](https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/16.0.1/72x72/1f4a5.png) In an exclusive interview with Atlas21, [@tierotiero](https://twitter.com/tierotiero?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw) from [@ArkLabsHQ](https://twitter.com/ArkLabsHQ?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw) commented on the launch of [@arkade\\_os](https://twitter.com/arkade_os?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw), its implications for the Lightning Network, and the announcement of the Arkade Assets protocol. [pic.twitter.com/cbcBE4qxFR](https://t.co/cbcBE4qxFR)\n> \n> — Atlas21 (@Atlas21\\_news) [October 22, 2025](https://twitter.com/Atlas21_news/status/1981014233656746136?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw)\n\n![](https://i0.wp.com/atlas21.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/photo_2025-10-22_09-54-22-2.jpg?resize=961%2C998&ssl=1)\n\nBuilt on top of the Ark protocol, Arkade is a programmable execution layer that enables the development of native applications on Bitcoin, including payments, lending, trading, and programmable vaults, leveraging the concept of **VTXO** (virtual transaction output), off-chain representations of classic UTXOs. The system allows for instant transactions and settlement, ensuring users maintain full control over their funds through unilateral exit mechanisms.\n\n![](https://i0.wp.com/atlas21.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/photo_2025-10-22_09-54-22.jpg?resize=1024%2C559&ssl=1)\n\nThe arrival of **Arkade Script** was also announced, a scripting language for Bitcoin-compatible smart contracts. The infrastructure is **open source**, with **SDKs** available in TypeScript, Golang, and Rust for integration into wallets, payment applications, and decentralized services.\n\nAlongside the mainnet launch, Ark Labs presented **Arkade Assets**, a framework that extends Arkade’s virtualization model to include support for different types of assets, including the issuance of stablecoins and other tokens.\n\n### **Collaborations and interoperability**\n\nDuring the event, various panels and presentations highlighted the acceleration of interoperability and practical use cases made possible by Arkade:\n\n**Kilian Rausch**, CEO of Boltz, in his presentation “Building For Interoperability,” illustrated how Arkade’s integration on Boltz enables rapid swaps and a seamless user experience between on-chain, Lightning Network, Arkade, and Rootstock.\n\nIn the “Next-Generation Wallets” panel, **Roy Sheinfeld** (CEO of Breez), **Francis Pouliot** (CEO of Bull Bitcoin), and **Gareth Grobler** (CEO of LayerzWallet) discussed how the evolution of the Lightning Network and Arkade’s model are making wallets, swap providers, and payment processors like **BTCPay Server** interoperable. A case study from the **Baltic Honeybadger 2025** conference in **Riga** was cited, where approximately **1,300** payments were made through Arkade that, from the end user’s perspective, appeared identical to those made via Lightning. Francis Pouliot also confirmed that Bull Bitcoin is testing Arkade integration into **BULL Wallet**.\n\nDuring the “P2P Finance” panel, **Anna** (CEO of Hodl Hodl) and **Philipp Hoenisch** (CEO of Lendasat) explored how Arkade offers a fast and secure solution for lending and collateral settlement in bitcoin. Hoenisch announced direct integration between Arkade and Lendasat, allowing users to use Arkade to deposit bitcoin and access small loans in a simple and immediate way.\n\nThe platform is already operational in beta ([https://arkade.money](https://arkade.money)) and ready for developers, but is expected to evolve rapidly in the coming weeks with the introduction of new features.\n\nThe post [Arkade activation day: the new layer 2 from Ark Labs debuts](https://atlas21.com/arkade-activation-day-the-new-layer-2-from-ark-labs-debuts/) appeared first on [Atlas21](https://atlas21.com).",

      "title": "day seven: back to dublin",
      "summary": "after a long night of limping and hunting for food in a half-closed town, i ended up in a locals-only pub, got adopted by a guy named kevin who kept handing me guinness, and then caught the early bus back to dublin. there, i slipped some of my dad’s and bill’s ashes into the crypt at st. michan’s, swapped my heavy pack for lighter gear, saw friends, and heard live trad music — and decided it was time to get my wrecked leg checked before pushing on.",
      "content": "> *\\[ Edited: 10/25/2025 this is a repost of a series i wrote in 2022, migrating it to the new nostr website ]*\n\ni finished the work zoom. that’s too kind: i finished frustratingly complaining to some vendors that were ignoring the issues that they caused on my network. to be taken from my vacation every night to deal with issues that shouldn’t be happening — and to get no response from these guys for hours at a time — i had to let them know that i was upset. while they knew i was out of the country, i shared with them WHY i was out of the country, that they were interrupting my ash-scattering journey. but enough of that. i chose not to dwell on it… i was HUNGRY.\n\ni walked around the town, looking for something open around dinner time. the river’s edge restaurant had great reviews and food photos, but only opened thursday through sunday. american style diner, also closed. my choices narrow down to pizza, chinese, or takeaway unless it’s thursday through sunday. i pop into a pub, andrew redmond and sons, on the way to pick up some takeaway, in hopes that maybe they served some pub grub.\n\n… they did not. this place was a hole in the wall, divey type of pub with one thing on the menu: booze. in fact, every head in the bar turned to look at me (record scratch! stop!) when i walked in. i think i found the locals bar! about 15 irish males, mostly in their 50s and 60s were watching soccer and throwing back guinnesses. while everyone turned to check me out, they quickly went back to what they were doing. so i hopped on a bar stool between an older dark haired man and a younger guy with wild unkempt hair. and promptly ordered a pint of the guinness. i finish two gulps of the beer in silence, trying to connect eyes with one of these guys to strike up a convo, but also keen to not interrupt their soccer match. i started to noticed a strong smell of urine, which made the beer taste off, and figure *eh… i’ll cut my losses, finish the beer and head out to mick the chipper,&#x20;*&#x74;he closest takeaway requiring the least number of body-numbing steps. as i am about to finish my beer, the wild-haired gent next to me hands me another guinness.\n\n“ble blah ble per **guinness&#x20;**&#x70;le bler,” he said.\n\n“oh thank you! wow.” i learned his name was kevin, and that even took some time to grok, as only every 5th word was audible and understandable sounding very much like popeye the sailor man’s under-the-breath mutterings.\n\nwe proceeded to attempt a discussion, me cluing into every 5th word and assuming what he said around it.\n\n“blah blur be poer **bunclody** frem?”\n\n“i just came from clonegall, the end of the wicklow way. i’m hiking my way across the country.” he smiled and nodded.\n\n“oh pla berr stu **tent** per you **camp** innera?”\n\n“yep, camping in a tent wherever i can. or when i need a shower, finding a town with a hotel. i’m at the clody lodge across the street tonight.”\n\nthis continues on, with him saying in the most clearly defined sentence he spoke “he’s doing what johnny did!”, to the darker haired fellow. that guy let out a hearty laugh and joined in the discussion. he was even harder to understand, with his words all tightly joined together into one beer-laced irish brogue.\n\na younger man enters from the backdoor with a cowboy hat on.\n\n“doinwhatjohnnydid!” they slur to him, nodding toward me.\n\ni could easily understand this guy, who was maybe 50 years old at most, very fit, and hadn’t yet had 10 beers to change his speech. he hikes routinely, but not for the last few years as he has 2 young children at the house now. in fact, he just popped in for a quick pint before he had to go pick up his daughter at dance class. he gave me a few pointers for the south leinster way, which i would be starting shortly. but he also suggested, like others before, to skip the next few legs and go over to the ring of kerry or the dingle peninsula and hike that instead. “s’the best use of yer time here!”\n\n![](https://gowithbflow.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/7af491af94dfcd862df1310181beedf3.gif?w=1024)\n\ni finished the second pint and told kevin and my new friends that would return after i got something to eat. i headed to mick the chipper and got some beef curry and then back to my hotel room with that new annoying limp, the guinnesses not helping my leg feel any better. (“guinness for health” my ass!) i downed the curry in 5 minutes: it was quite excellent or i was incredibly famished. i thought about my new friends waiting at redmond’s — but decided to go to bed instead. i didn’t have the mental capacity to decipher the conversation anymore, anyway. plus, i had to get up early to catch one of the only two buses out of town.\n\nin the middle of the night, i woke up with a painful cramp in the calf of the gimp leg. i threw off the covers and tried to stand up quickly or i knew i would be writhing in pain and unable to get up to relieve it. walking around is the only way to get rid of them. i remember wondering *where am i*? with only a dim light coming from the crack under the door, i couldn’t make out the furniture based on the shadows. *am i in tent? am i back in philly? am i in mick’s house*? it takes 20 seconds for my mind to adjust and recall i’m in bunclody. i shake my head aggressively, as if to snap myself back to reality, and lie back down.\n\n## \\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\n\ni wake up feeling groggy. i didn’t sleep well, tossing and turning constantly. that’s not like me; i am able to sleep anywhere at anytime. but between my ailing leg and my mind overly alert from a new place every night, i just couldn’t get comfortable. i see it’s 6 am on my watch. *oh well, i missed the first bus.* i pack up and walk down to the supermarket to inquire about the bus transit system. the store clerk was just opening his doors. he’s a very friendly fellow, more helpful than i had anticipated. he assured me i could pay with paper money and they would give me change, even though the bus websites said that they wouldn’t.\n\nwhile waiting for the bus, i talked with an older woman, mary, who must take the bus regularly. she told me about how so many places in town closed from the restrictive lockdowns for covid (people couldn’t leave a specific, eventually expanding, perimeter around their hometown in ireland). she also theorized that there weren’t enough chefs or workers in general to keep everything open. she noted that on a random wednesday night at 9pm, the town center would be empty right now because people got used to (or even enjoyed) staying in for the night instead of walking about town. optimistically, she mentioned that several new places have already opened “on the edges of the town.” it’s a shame that they aren’t opening in the middle of town, but i imagine the rent is more expensive. you would think building owners would negotiate to get their spaces filled, yet many stores remained closed or boarded up. she mentioned that they were investing big money in a hotel near the golf course, too, again on the edge of town.\n\nthe loss of main streets has also hit america hard. when small towns lose their economic engines in the center of town, the whole town suffers. and, even more drastically, you start to loosen the threads that keep a tight-knit community together. when you’re not walking to the store and saying hello to your neighbors — catching up on town happenings or just generally keeping in touch — community seems to unwind. i have experienced this in america, and it would pain me to see it happen in small-town ireland. that’s one of the things, i think, that makes me enjoy going there so much. everyone knows everyone, and they all know when a traveler is coming through. i hope the world can recover quickly from this.\n\nthe bus arrives, the driver opens the door. “aw goo’mornin’ mary! headed to baltinglass?” “g’morning luv, aye i am.” he gives me a similarly affable greeting and asks where i am headed. i pay the €14.50 requested to city center and sit down behind mary. i listen as the bus driver greets every person getting on the bus by name while anticipating their destination. this happened not just in bunclody, but all along the route he has probably driven for the past decade or more.\n\n“hiyya jackie, headed to dublin city center?” he asked.\n\n“ye, i’m t’irsty and want to see if there’s any more rain up there.” he jokes, as bunclody just went through a 3 day rainstorm before i arrived.\n\n“oh they had lots last night,” he replied. somehow i kept missing the rain. when i wasn’t in dublin, it was raining there. before i arrived in bunclody, it rained there. my path was optimally (by sheer luck) avoiding all precipitation.\n\ni spent the bus ride writing, drifting in and out of thought, occasionally interrupted by someone getting on or off the bus. before i knew it, i looked up and saw the ha’penny bridge in dublin over the river liffey. *oh! i’m right near st. michan’s!* i told the driver i was getting off at the next stop instead.\n\nst. michan’s is this hidden gem in dublin. it’s a very old, still-active church that has a crypt underneath it with often times stacked coffins. it is obviously illegal to bust open coffins and disturb the deceased’s remains, but sometimes the wood gives way and the coffin collapses on itself. during the cleanup of one such instance, the mummified remains of several bodies were exposed in the crypt many years ago. there are theories as to why the remains are mummified (limestone basement walls creating a dry environment, methane gas from being built on a former swampland). whatever is preserving their bodies is also destroying the wood. the main room has 4 mummies in it, two women and two men. the one man had his feet chopped off, suspected of being a thief (but later possibly becoming a priest, which would explain being in the crypt). the two women were well preserved. the prized jewel here is a 900 year old mummy believed to be a crusader. this soldier was incredibly tall (estimated to be 6′ 5″, which was giant-size in his world). his legs were broken in half and folded under him so that he could fit into the coffin!\n\n![](https://gowithbflow.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/img_4253.jpg?w=1024)\n\n> the main mummy room\n\nmy dad went to st. michan’s in 2003, and he got such a kick out of the (quite excellent) tour guide that he refused to let people go to dublin without insisting that they checked out st. michan’s crypts. peter, as i later learned was his name as he is still doing the tours nearly 20 years later, starts the tour with a “so you want to see the mummies?” or a “so you are here to see the crypt?” in an impression of the ‘tales from the crypt’ cryptkeeper’s gait and voice.\n\nwhen i came myself in 2003 (and again in 2012 and 2015), at my dad’s urging, the crusader had his hand extended out of the coffin. and the finger looked petrified. as the tour went on back then, a superstition was revealed to us that rubbing the finger while making a wish would ensure it came true. so of course about half of every hourly tour was not grossed out enough to rub the finger for luck. sadly, the hand was not extended anymore. i asked peter what happened, and he told us that in 2019, the crypt was broken into and desecrated. The Crusader’s head and some bones were stolen, the women were turned over in their grave, and the thief was decapitated. they eventually found the vandal, and thus the bones and head, but the extended hand collapsed and disintegrated to a point that it was no longer safe to touch. what a bummer! people can really be such assholes.\n\n<https://blossom.primal.net/51fbec9ed528067ef1a378f4a18e3d0d7714eda7f6f44234c2571eb20707e7e3.mp4>\n\n> the cryptkeeper (so worth the €7 tour fee!)\n\ni had a great chat with peter for 10-15 minutes as the other tour guests left. i told him all about my dad’s love of him and this tour, that my dad had probably sent close to 100 people his way… and about my adventure spreading ashes across ireland. i asked if i could drop some ashes down below in the crypt. he said “no” but winked when he said it… or at least i thought i saw a wink. so i dropped a small pinch of bill’s and my dad’s ashes sneakily so the other tour guests didn’t see. my dad would certainly love to know that a little bit of him is down there with the mummies. considering bill’s skull tattoos, he’d probably get a kick out of it too!\n\n<https://blossom.primal.net/cccab5029842b21c33fc8f83dc1e36667e903ba508d9b8a7fc91b296fc6710fb.mp4>\n\n> scattering ashes in the crypt. oops busted, left my flash on!\n\nwalking out of the church, i remembered that my friend chalk (my housemate trevor’s girlfriend) was in ireland with her family. we had intentionally made no promises of meeting up while we both were in the emerald island; if fate brought us together in the same area at the same time, so be it! i shot her a text. “hey i am randomly back in dublin to ditch some weight for the night.” then i hopped in a cab to head back to mick and ann marie’s to drop off my bag. still wearing my hiking boots, i was somewhat desperate to put on something more comfortable for street walking. traveling as lightly as possible, however, i didn’t have any other shoes. ann marie graciously took me to the mall after we surprised the girls by picking them up at their schools. they were shocked to see me so soon! they thought it would be 3 weeks until they saw me, so i got some running leaps, hugs, and screams of ‘briannn!’.\n\n![](https://gowithbflow.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/img_4260.jpg?w=1024)\n\n> uncle b hates his ice cream\n\nat the mall, i bought some cozy nikes (pronounced with one syllable in ireland… rhymes with mike’s) and some ankle hugging thin non-hiking socks. my feet were feeling pretty happy (my lower leg was another story, but the pain was tolerable until i overused it by the end of the day). of course, we were at the mall with uncle b… so i treated the girls to some ridiculously large ice cream sundaes. we headed back to the house and drew portraits of each other. clodagh told me hers was “way better” than mine (and made herself a medal for beating me!). i let her win that one because chalk had just texted me back that she happened to be in dublin as well, and they were planning to go to a traditional irish music jam session. perfect!\n\n![](https://gowithbflow.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/img_9009.jpg?w=768)\n\n> got to hang with chalk without hiking boots\n\ni hopped onto the bus and made my way back down into city center. we hung out at the cobblestone pub, staying for several hours to enjoy the live trad music. i was constantly impressed with how musicians joined and left the music circle so seamlessly that the melodious sounds never stopped. it was impressive and delighted my ears. pub patrons would sometimes get loud, talking to each other with voices rising as the ambient noise in the bar picked up. the bartenders would occasionally politely say “this IS a music bar, please be quiet.” and they would shut up for a few minutes until the sounds built to a crescendo again. enter the tin flute. this old white-haired jolly irish gentleman was playing the tin flute, and he seemed to have control over the crowd volume without effort. the second he started playing, the room got quiet. it was beautiful and peacful, or haunting and eery, but always melodic. he was a master. and he earned his respect, apparently. i couldn’t get over how no one dared make a peep the moment the first note left his flute, every time.\n\n<https://blossom.primal.net/6ed3209e408004231f228bb1b88b75536e61c97768cfff9e03eee59266e2c831.mp4>\n\n> cobblestone pub\n\nwe had a fantastic meal around the corner at oscar’s cafe bar (thank you for the recommendation to the bartender, and to chalk’s aunt and uncle for treating!) and then mary pat, chalk and i went to *brazen head*, the oldest pub in dublin, for a night cap as mary pat’s parents went home. we were all pretty exhausted, but i could tell that mary pat, being younger than chelsea and i, was still ready to rip it. she had decided that she was moving to ireland and even checked out some rental properties while she was here. i wish i had it in me to stay out past midnight, but i was eager to get back on the trail the next morning, so i didn’t. we did however do a celebratory shot of whiskey with her before calling it a night.\n\n![](https://gowithbflow.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/img_4276.jpg?w=1024)\n\nthis was a good diversion, a good idea to come back to dublin. i got to see chelsea (and meet her family) and reduce my load before continuing. consensus was that i should get my leg checked out before i headed south and continued my trek across the motherland.\n\nso that became my plan.\n\ndo you agree, chalk?\n\n![](https://gowithbflow.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/img_6356.jpg?w=768)\n\n> she agrees.\n\n\\#travel #ireland2022\n",

i’ve never had them before. maybe i have a stress fracture? can i continue on at this pace? should i stay in tinahely another night and crash that wedding?* thoughts race through my head as i get ready for bed, wanting nothing more than a fresh pair of socks to soothe my throbbing feet. *i need to consult my running friends about shin splints, get some advice.* i dig through my ruck sack for my charger, and i miraculously remembered that, as i was walking out of my west philly bedroom, i threw one more pair of clean socks into the tiny pocket under my water bottle. *was that a dream, or did i really spoil myself?* i eagerly sought to find out, tearing open the zipper and — out popped the overstuffed clean fabric of two waterproof socks. i didn’t think i could be so happy from a pair of clean socks. i immediately put them on and laid down in comfort, ready for sleep. i don’t usually sleep with socks on at home, but the tightness of these waterproof socks was instantly soothing.\n\ni woke up at 7am. my body feels rested from a good night’s sleep. my right foot calmed down but my left foot and lower leg still had the echos of the previous day’s 20-mile hike. i knew when i started hiking, that echo would turn louder into a full-on scream. but the show must go on.  wake, yoga, teeth, pack. ready for my full irish! the typical breakfast was served from 9 to 11 am. because i requested an earlier exit, the chef himself sat me in an empty dining room. this was great, because it gave us time to chat.\n\n“finishing the wicklow way, huh? ugh” he says with a dismissive swipe of the forearm in disgust. “this last part isn’t worth it. don’t do it. it’s like 70% on roads with cars. the only good part is the shebeen.” \n\n“the what?”\n\n“the shebeen. illegal pub.”\n\n“oh! like a speakeasy. where’s that?”\n\n“look for ‘the dying cow’ pub. there’s no sign, just a white building. it used to be a shebeen. legit now, tho. it’s been in the same family for the last three hundred years.”\n\ni looked it up really quickly to see how far off the trail it was. “oh man, it says it doesn’t open until 11 am. i will be passing by around 10.”\n\n“oh just knock up! tha woman who runs it will serve you a pint. she’s 90 years old. knock loudly!”\n\ni devour the complimentary full irish, and realize i don’t have any coins for a tip. i told him i would be right back. i walked over to the fruit stand and got 2 apples for my hike and brought my man back a €2 coin for a tip, for which he was surprised and grateful.\n\ni grab my bag and set off for the day. instead of backtracking up to the trail 1.5 miles, i take the road that goes right to ‘the dying cow.’ the routes took roughly the same time to traverse, and the bar is right on the wicklow way, conveniently. it would take me about 2 hours to get there.\n\n![](https://gowithbflow.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/img_4197.jpg?w=1024)\n\n> more gorgeous than sausages?\n\ni follow the gps and pass a lot of cars heading to work or driving children to school. i was definitely walking with a little bit of a limp, with my left leg not fully cooperating. i pass several old men gardening, and exchange a g’mornin’ with each. with a white building in my field of view, atop a hill looking down on cow pastures, i get excited for a cold guinness. i start walking down the hill, watching google maps to see which of the white buildings on the horizon might be this unmarked shebeen.\n\n![](https://gowithbflow.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/img_4198.jpg?w=1024)\n\n> crosses and cows\n\n![](https://gowithbflow.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/img_4199.jpg?w=1024)\n\n> lots of white buildings, where’s ‘the cow’\n\ntwo young guys approached me, looking more lost than me.\n\n“hey bruh. can you help? you know how to get to the shops?”\n\n“i can try. you see this backpack tho?” i said pointing to my back. “i’m just passing through! what shops?”\n\n“i know there are shops close to here. he says it’s that way,” he said pointing northwest, “but i think it’s that way”, pointing due south.\n\n“umm, i just came from a little village about 1.5 hours away that has a bunch of shops,” i mentioned, throwing my thumb toward the southeast direction behind me.\n\n“no, it’s closer than that.”\n\n“ok, let’s see if i can pull up google maps satellite.” we search the nearby areas for what might appear from the sky to be shops. most look like farms or solo structures from above, nothing really resembling a town center. “where are you coming from?”\n\n“up the street bruh” they pointed to where i was headed.\n\n“oh do yo know ‘the dying cow’?”\n\n“oh course man! we were there last night. so fun! no one is there now. we just moved here from south africa. just trying to figure out where ‘here’ is tho.”\n\ni tell them what i am doing, walking coast to coast, spreading my dad’s and bill’s ashes. and that i am about 85 miles into my trek. i laughed and continued to hunt for stores. “here’s a town about an hour away. but it only looks like 1 or 2 shops.” \n\n“nah, not it. can i look?” i hand him my phone and he starts scrolling through the map tiles. “oh this looks like it… tinahely.”\n\n“that’s where i just came from!”\n\n“oh man, and it’s an hour and a half walk? that’s sucks” \n\n“just about. but i have a back pack and a limp, you can do it faster.”\n\n“here we are complaining about 3 miles, and dis oom’s walking 380.” the quieter of the two spoke up, laughing.\n\n“make a left at the stone cross down that hill, and it’s basically straight ahead. good luck guys!”\n\n![](https://gowithbflow.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/img_4205.jpg?w=1024)\n\n> tallon’s ‘the dying cow’ pub\n\n![](https://gowithbflow.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/img_4207.jpg?w=1024)\n\n> what a drinking view!\n\ni walk up the hill and immediately noticed small signage for ‘the dying cow:’ proof the chef probably hadn’t been here in a while. the place was empty, the doors were shut, the lights were off. after my 20 minute chat with the south africans, it was around 10:40, so i figured i could wait until the advertised 11 am opening. i dropped mr. osprey and looked around. there’s a great tree trunk carving of a hiker and his dog across the street. there are two seprate seating areas with small fireplaces adjacent. this was very clearly a small side addition to a farmhouse where the proprietress probably lived. this would have been an incredible pub to hang out in for a few hours. my breakfast chef told me they were very welcoming to hikers and allowed people to pitch tents in the backyard all the time (i wish i had known that and planned for it!). not only did the pub have a sign, it also had two historical plaques with two different stories about the name of the pub (so very irish), which i combined into one for clarity here:\n\n![](https://gowithbflow.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/img_4200.jpg?w=768)\n\n> wood carving outside the pub\n\n“The name of the pub originated from an incident said to have happened around the 1920’s when a group of people were caught drinking there on a Sunday night. According to the rules, to qualify for late night or all day drinking on a Sunday in Ireland and Great Britain, one is required to have “travelled in good faith for a distance of three miles, by public thoroughfare, from the place they spent the night.” Travelling in good faith meant that you could not be “travelling for the purpose of taking refreshment”… the elderly landlady tried all her charm to the Guardi claiming “Sure you wouldn’t summons an old woman! These men were only helping me with a dying cow.” … The pub has a long tradition of card playing and an assumption upon entering that you leave your feelings and emotions at the door.”\n\nand here’s an even more elaborate and colorful irish retelling of the story — which i highly recommend you read. [*https://medium.com/@mtallon245/an-irishmans-story-part-one-36dfe4d0a330*](https://medium.com/@mtallon245/an-irishmans-story-part-one-36dfe4d0a330)\n\nat 10:55, one of the doors swung open. i assumed it was the owner opening up. i walked into those doors very excitedly, anticipating a cold guinness… but it was just the water closets. no one was around, no entrance into the main pub. a wind gust must have opened the door. how disappointing!\n\ni walk back outside, walk all the way around the building, and peek into any window i could. it’s so painfully adorable in there, but it’s also dark and still. no one is around. 11 am hits. no one opens the door. 11:15, i knock on the front door to the pub and to the farmhouse. no one answers. i think back to the hotel chef telling me that the owner is a 90 year old woman. “let her sleep in, brian!” i waited 5 more minutes, and left disappointed. my heart as empty as my stomach. no guiness for me. no dying cow drinking story to relay when i got home. i made a mental note to come back here next time i come to ireland. this is my kind of place.\n\nhttps://blossom.primal.net/2d0003034895a9864e373c74555d63004ad4782dbf5fbe3342c28038bd369e5a.mp4\n\n> straight outta ‘the birds’\n\nas i hope back onto the trail, i feel like i am in the movie ‘the birds.’ hundreds of crows are cawing and swooping through the gorgeous skies. it’s as if there actually IS a dying cow and they’re all waiting to eat.\n\ni thought about my dad’s love of horror movies, and how he passed that along to many of us. i thought about how he would wait until the climax right before a scare, and throw a pillow at you from across the room with a loud yelp of terror. (this got you every time, and you’d jump out of your skin, even during movies you watched with him a dozen times). i thought about his love for halloween, and our resultant traditions of dressing up to scare the trick or treaters, haunted house style. and how amazingly fun it is. they were fleeting thoughts, but they were a nice distraction from my left leg.\n\ni continued the hike. this chef was correct in that this segment ran along a lot more roads. but i was still enjoying it. i started walking along a road with cows grazing on both sides of it. on my left, in the much bigger pasture full of heather flowers, grass, and sun, i see three groups of cows. they are separated from each other. but they all take a break from chewing to look at me. i laugh, thinking back to a road trip to my dad’s brother Jim’s farm in upstate new york. we are driving along in our 25 foot van, lovingly called “the fish tank” by my friends growing up. i’m sure it was a perfect time to stay inside your own head with random thoughts: 10 kids packed in like sardines, without air conditioning or a radio, for an 8-10 hour drive (uncle steve loves to retell this story, but i’m more remembering one random thought he shared along this ride). as my dad is driving, he’s watching the cows in the fields. deep in thought he blurts out, “do you think cows have gangs?”\n\nhttps://blossom.primal.net/365f21d4024dc3d7484a5155111e528a3715ba48bf5aee6cb9131996d7e8b4f5.mp4\n\nwe all laughed, but as i watched how they stayed in packs, you can definitely see why that thought popped up. i keep walking. i notice the field on the right is much smaller, not as sunny for whatever reason, and only had one cow gang in it. *these guys must be from the wrong side of the track*, i think to myself proud of my dad joke, walking on the physical track of which i speak.\n\nhttps://blossom.primal.net/f372d26b74eff60088cfd8a728ee83b5a4e721f48c2fcc9e2ac6595f8de2d6cc.mp4\n\nbut they didn’t find it funny. the cows started following me! every time i turned around they would stop moving and pretend that they weren’t obviously trailing me — *running* at times! i started laughing hard at this. i couldn’t believe they were doing it. i finally took out my camera to try to record them, and they stopped all together. busted! they were made!\n\nnow, this reminded me of a gary larson cartoon. my dad and i loved the far side comics. i kept waking and laughing in disbelief. i’m assuming the cows thought they were about to be fed? it got me pretty good tho.\n\n![](https://gowithbflow.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/img_4449.jpg?w=823)\n\n> gary was a genius\n\ni kept walking, kept the pace. i tried to ignore the fact that every step after about 5 miles in, was agony. *i need to at least finish the wicklow way. i can’t stop before that!* i took a break on a stone wall and ate an apple. i pulled out my map to strategize. at the start of the morning, i had about 18.5 miles in total to get to clonegall, the end of the wicklow way and the start of the south leinster way. i was about 3/4 of the way there. i had checked online multiple times for a place to stay in clonegall but i couldn’t find anything. there were some wild camping spots that were my original destination target, but i needed wifi to have a zoom meeting for work (ugh, i know). i was disappointed i couldn’t escape work, but some things only i can handle. i scouted a town nearby (\\~1.5 hours by foot) that had a hotel, so i booked that and figured, what’s another 3.5 miles? with the hotel booked, i continued on to clonegall.\n\n![](https://gowithbflow.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/img_4211.jpg?w=1024)\n\nthere were parts of this trail that got dangerous. not because of the terrain, but because of the speeding cars driving on not-wide-enough roads. several times i jammed myself into a thorn bush overhanging the road to give a farmer’s equipment room to get by. i got to a safe cutout, the entrance to a sheep farm, and drop my bag. i take a knee and have a piss. i haven’t seen anyone most of the day, so was surprised when a sheep farmer asked if i was okay. “i’m good! just having a rest!” i quickly finished relieving myself before he came over — but he went to opposite direction to tend to his flock. whew.\n\n![](https://gowithbflow.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/img_4230.jpg?w=1024)\n\n> clonegall: picturesque indeed!\n\ni finally make it to clonegall, and i am relieved. THE END of the wicklow way. this is a very picturesque village, but it was almost too much like a painting in that there was no movement at all, aside from the flowing river.\n\n**man this is anticlimactic!**\n\nat the end of the wicklow way, i didn’t know what to expect. but a town with no one walking around, no one there to say ‘hey good on you!’, was not it. i recalled what mickey said to me when i was questioning whether to reactivate social media for this trip: “remember, you’re not doing this for anyone but yourself.” that applies here too; i guess i don’t need to see anyone here. i’ll check out the village really quickly and then head to the town of bunclody for my hotel.\n\n![](https://gowithbflow.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/img_4220.jpg?w=1024)\n\n> off in the distance, the lovely couple ready their pub for tomorrow’s opening\n\nas i’m taking some photos of the nearby castle, and trying to capture the cuteness of the town, i see an old man and woman come out to clean the light on what looks like the only pub in town, OSBORNE. okay maybe they are just about to open!\n\nby the time i walked up to the bar, it’s just the old man on the ladder, cleaning the inside glass of the light. he clearly cared about this place.\n\n“hi there! are you open?”\n\n“no, no.” and that was all he said. i paused waiting for anything else, but it didn’t come.\n\n“oh, okay. is there anywhere open here to grab a drink or lunch?”\n\n“are ye starting the wicklow way?” he looked away from the light and at me for the first time.\n\n“i just finished!”\n\n“oh! come in. come in. my wife has a certificate for you.”\n\n“oh really? that’s great!” he slowly gets down from the ladder, as a septuagenarian should. i offer to carry his supplies in, but he just motions for me to go in ahead of him. \n\n“he just finished! he needs a certificate!”\n\n![](https://gowithbflow.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/img_4225.jpg?w=1024)\n\n> shelves appear to float and maintain gravity’s laws at the same time… how did i not ask this couple for a photo with them, they were amazing!\n\nthe bar is dark, and in slight disarray. but it looks like something out of a harry potter set, with unleveled shelves somehow delicately holding up racks of bottles, with a bar-top made out of surplus coffin lids, with atmospheric lighting welcoming you deeper into the bar and if you’re lucky, into the back room that has a fireplace. i learn that they are only open thursday through sunday nights. this was a wednesday, so sadly i am left out again. she confirms my suspicion that their hours are due to covid lockdowns and the travel sector not fully revived yet… but i think their old age may also have something to do with it. it was wednesday and they were finally getting around to tidying up from sunday’s open hours.\n\n“can i pour ya a pint?”\n\n“i’d love to buy one” i say, making sure she knows i’m not looking for a handout. man, i love this irish couple so much.\n\n![](https://gowithbflow.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/img_4227.jpg?w=768)\n\n> WOO HOO! official date stamp and everything!\n\ni learn that they have been giving out these certificates since the wicklow way opened, some 30 years ago. i’m sure she has seen it all, heard every story. she told me about a girl last week from australia that broke down in tears at the bar. when she asked what was wrong, the girl told her that she had just completed the wicklow way in seven days. she was fine for the first four days, but she was so incredibly lonely the last three days. she couldn’t handle it, and kept trying to find a way to quit. so i asked, “were these tears of joy that she finished?” the woman replied “i don’t think she knew!”\n\ni told her that i started at poolbeg lighthouse, 9 miles from marlay park. and that i took the day off yesterday to heal. so leaving the trail like that for a hotel, and more importantly a bath that i could soak in, presented me with lots of people i could talk to. i haven’t really felt lonely at all on the trip. i had read lots of reviews about people taking these long multi-day hikes and feeling very lonely. i guess i just know that i’m close enough to a town that i could walk to and start up a conversation? it also helps that i have my cell phone on me, with data turned on (i couldn’t negotiate my way out of that, work required it. my original plan was no cell phone. my mom would have killed me if i tried that tho). her husband walks in with the ladder as i’m finishing my second pint. i felt weird drinking while they were cleaning, but they seemed to enjoy the company.\n\n“this war isn’t ending anytime soon. putin won’t stop.” he says out of nowhere.\n\n“yeah it’s terrible! if he gets away with taking ukraine, he’ll roll into the next country right away.”\n\nhe paused in thought. “greed is an odd thing, isn’t it” he says shaking his head. clearly this man does not have a greedy bone in his body. working the same small bar for decades in a simple and happy life. “do you have a place to stay? lots of refugees right now.”\n\n“i couldn’t find anything in clonegall so i’m headed to bunclody.” i finish the small bag of potato crisps that they gave me, and drank the last sip from the third pint. i had walking to do, as much as i’d rather hang out. i remembered ben franklin’s quote “fish and company smell after three days” and assumed it applied to beers at a closed pub as well. three pints and don’t overstay your welcome.\n\n![](https://gowithbflow.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/img_4213.jpg?w=1024)\n\n> shillelagh detour, cute af\n\n![](https://gowithbflow.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/img_4214.jpg?w=1024)\n\n> town famous for their walking (band battle!) sticks made of blackthorn\n\ni load my pack onto my back and head south. every step i make with my left leg feels like someone is stabbing me on the shin and dragging the knife up to my knee or down to the top of my foot. it was not comfortable. as i’m walking, i take out my phone and check to see if bunclody is big enough for a routine bus schedule. (many small villages don’t have public transportation options, or have a once or twice a week bus roll through). bunclody has 2 busses to dublin tomorrow at 6 am and 7:50am. BINGO! i’m going to go back to dublin in the morning and swap out this huge backpack for a smaller day bag. the next section of the trail can weave through a town every night, so i can carefully plan my route to avoid camping (and about 30 lbs of gear). this is my answer! i’ll come back to dublin in a week and get the camp gear for the kerry way and beara way. surely this will relieve whatever is going on with my leg.\n\n![](https://gowithbflow.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/img_4232.jpg?w=1024)\n\n> friendly greeting by two asses\n\ni’m so distracted by my thoughts that i don’t realize i’m already almost in bunclody. i arrive, find my hotel, and ditch my bag all in short order. i take off my shoes, and i sit staring at my left leg. it looks like the pillsbury dough boy wearing a sweater three sizes too small. i am so swollen. my right leg feels pretty great, all things considered. the rest of my body felt fine. i thought it was weird to get shin splints in one leg. so i started thinking *maybe it was a stress fracture*. *maybe i shouldn’t be doing 22 mile hikes, like today. maybe while i’m in dublin i should go get this checked out before i come back down. maybe…*\n\noh shit!\n\ni have a work zoom in 10 minutes. let me look presentable. i hopped in the shower, tried to shift my focus to 3300 miles away back in america.\n\nmy body couldn’t have felt farther from my mind than at that moment.\n\n\\#travel #ireland2022\n",

      "content": "**DAY FIVE “REST” HIKE**: 7 miles\n\nmy initial impression of tinahely, as i shuffled through the streets to find murphy’s hotel, was that covid hit it kind of hard. there were several boarded up shops, including maggie’s pub and a black tom’s bar. both had good reviews on google so i’m assuming they were covid fatalities. it was a small village, with a unique triangular “town square” in the middle of it (how irish!).\n\nafter being checked in, i did as anticipated: a hot soak almost immediately, right after taking my boots off the second i walked in the door. i counted four blisters either forming or fully developed. i had a weird bruise at the base of my big toe. i stayed in the very long tub for a very long hour. it was a luxury to have a tub a tall man could actually fit in. they know what’s up. i cleaned my feet well, and noticed a weird ripple of skin on the underside of my foot, like a peak and valley i climbed earlier that day. touching it didn’t feel great. but it felt like the foot was starting to prune up. so i got out. i laid down and told myself 5 minutes.\n\nan hour later i got up and went down for a burger and a beer. i tried to strike up a conversation with the bartender, with the locals i sat next to, with anyone but a sheep or a cow. no one was very chatty. and the accents were very hard to chew through. i’m decent at hearing and deciphering a brogue, but for them i certainly needed subtitles. maybe it’s just because it was beer o’clock, and my brain was as tired as my legs.\n\nthat’s odd. this is the first irish town i’ve been to that didn’t feel very welcoming to me. i knew that couldn’t be true: it had to just be my mood. murphy’s hotel pub might just be a quiet type of bar. i finished my meal with enough pleasantries and small talk, but mostly overhearing the bartender chat up the guys that probably sit on the same stool every day. “brendan fell asleep making a pizza. the fooker burnt it black. luckily i came home and took it out of the oven. whole place filled with smoke. he woke up and looks at me an says ‘the fook did ya do to me pizza?’” they let out a belly laugh. that part i understood. laughter is a universal language. i was beat, and so i went to bed at maybe 9.\n\ni woke up feeling more myself. i should have apologized to my bag for kicking him over but the emotions of the day got to me. i did some yoga, and noticed that my lower legs still really didn’t feel great. the tops of my feet felt like a taught rubber band about to snap. the blisters contorted to my boot’s insoles but didn’t burst. i went down for a “full irish”. my dad would have been appalled that it took me 6 days in ireland before i had a full irish.\n\n![](https://gowithbflow.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/img_4135.jpg?w=962)\n\n> full irish\n\na full irish is a hearty meal fit for field work — or a hiker. 2 eggs, gorgeous irish sausage, irish bacon, white pudding and blood pudding (these are akin to scrapple, kind of), mushrooms, grilled tomato, and baked beans. complete with tea and irish brown bread slathered with kerrygold butter, it’s a dang feast. i don’t usually eat the mushrooms or the blood pudding — the mushrooms make it taste too fungus-y and the blood makes it tastes too iron-y for me. but this hotel had a pretty good one. “can i add another night to my stay?” “sure t’ing!” i gobbled it up and went to check out the town a bit.\n\n![](https://gowithbflow.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/img_4139.jpg?w=1024)\n\n> green cuisine: fresh fruits and veg\n\naround the first bend, the first thing i see is a fruit stand. and what do we do when we see a fruit stand? right, we check the prices! my dad couldn’t go by someone selling fruits and vegetables without checking out the quality, the price, and if there was any varietal he didn’t know. the only thing that was different here, though, were some of the names (not “red delicious” but “red chief”, not “arugula”but “rocket”). it’s kind of wild that our food is so similar thousands of miles away. this store was screaming vibes of tony’s produce and flounders’ produce, my dad’s old produce stores. i looked around, chatted up the proprietress, and bought a couple of apples. and smiled the whole time.\n\ni kept walking through town. noticing the different stores, many were named murphy’s like the hotel. murphy’s butcher, murphy’s leather, murphy furniture warehouse. and then there was coffee dlite and o’connor’s bar and lounge. i took mental notes to return to those two. no one was really walking around town, so i went back up to my room to do a little writing. an hour or two later, i come back down for the coffee shop. i notice a sign in the town triangle that had lots of nearby landmarks listed. some of them would have been cool to check out with a car.\n\none landmark at the bottom right caught my eye. Toberpatrick Holy Well. wait, patrick, huh? what’s that! i read the little description and see it’s wicklow’s best preserved drinking well from the time of — and blessed by — st. patrick. and there is a hawthorn tree there onto which people tie personal belongings, symbolizing “handing over our personal challenges to the Divine.”\n\n**the signage in town:**\n\n“St Patrick’s Well, one of Wicklows best known heritage sites is said to have been blessed by St Patrick on his travels around Ireland, some one & a half thousand years ago. The well in turn gives its name to the local area of Toberpatrick, “Tober” being the irish for “The Well”, thus “the well of Patrick.” The well provided a source of excellent spring water for the families in the local area. The water was transported by a locally designed and built, horse drawn water cart. “\n\ni randomly happened upon a town that was so close to a well that was called “the well of patrick”? because my legs hurt and i couldn’t go on farther? it was meant to be: i definitely need to leave some ashes at “the well of patrick.” but it’s a 3.5 mile walk on my rest day. the taxi app has nothing available in this area. i checked google to see how easy the walk may be.\n\n“It is situated on Baileys Farm in County Wicklow. The owners, the Hayden family supply milk for Baileys Irish Cream.”\n\nsold! i’ll make the trek, bagless and it shouldn’t be too bad. i head back into the hotel to grab some water and my steripen, in case the well is still in use. it would be cool to drink from patrick’s well. i check in with the new bartender, a very pretty young irish girl who was very cheerful. and easier for me to understand than the older woman last night.\n\n“is the walk to toberpatrick easy to follow?”\n\n“yes very! it’s a wee far tho.” she replied.\n\n“i noticed.” the times on google map make me laugh for everything. 3.5 mile walk: 1 hour and 40 minute walk or … 7 minute drive. the hills’ll getcha! “any interest in driving me there for €20?”\n\n“i’d drive ye for nuttin, but i’m working till half 8!”\n\n“alright, i’ll be back in 3 hours!” it was 3 pm already. this would be a nice walk before dinner. “last question. is the well still used?”\n\n“i wouldn’t!” she laughed.\n\nthe walk was mostly on roads just barely enough for 2 cars let alone pedestrians. and the cars never seemed to notice you walking until the very last second. it was warm and my fleece started sticking to my sweaty arms, so i took it off. about 2 miles in, google tells me “turn right on unnamed road for a half mile, make a left on unnamed road.” you have to love that. i don’t know what we would do without modern gps and mapping technology. as recently as a couple months ago, the girl i was dating smacked my phone out of my hand “you and your google! let’s wander around until we find somewhere to eat or something that looks fun.” she wasn’t wrong! i do that all the time when i’m traveling, but in my hometown i like to be direct i guess. but not as direct as my deceased friend pat mulhern. that man would put his gps on even if he was going 3 blocks away. we used to bust his balls for that all the time. i laughed to myself when i thought about just how crazy that was, and thought maybe i should try the wander method more at home.\n\n![](https://gowithbflow.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/img_4151.jpg?w=1024)\n\n> st. patrick’s well\n\ni arrive at the religious well, a serene and very calming and unassuming landmark tucked behind an old wooden fence. i snap a photo of the sign and advance toward a craggily twisted tree with lots of pieces of clothing tied to the branches. there are personal photos, i assume of sick or dead loved ones. there are statues of st patrick and candles surrounding the well that has a spring running from it.\n\n![](https://gowithbflow.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/img_4154.jpg?w=1024)\n\n![](https://gowithbflow.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/img_4155.jpg?w=1024)\n\n> tying personal belongings to the tree\n\nthere’s a nice bench to the left. i sit down and have a rest, and think about those that i’ve lost over the years, including my grandparents, uncle vince, aunt helene, uncle tom. and i take out the glass vials of ashes from my pocket and rest them on the bench. the well started bubbling up, air escaping from the rocks below? water filling the well from the water table? my dad patrick or patrick mulhern saying hello?\n\n<https://blossom.primal.net/f8806464b0afae112bb7e50100c79a080eb57d54177c4aa5743035bc163c7b70.mp4>\n\n> bubbling well\n\ni decided not to put the ashes in the well water, just in case it was actually used. i opted instead for scattering them at the roots of the hawthorn tree. i opened both vials and tapped the rims to let the ashes out.\n\n<https://blossom.primal.net/477012cd00e134104060c157e5d053adf051c146db99264ea6d0e3093eaaa173.mp4>\n\n> spreading some ashes at “patrick’s well“\n\ni grabbbed my hydro flask and dumped out the rest of the water and then filled it with the well water. why not! i’m here! i used the steripen for 90 seconds to purify the water. i took a small sip to taste any obvious bad tastes. tasted like pure spring water. i chugged half a liter, a little too aggressively. some spilled out near the corner of my mouth. oops! hurriedly, i screwed the cap back on as it was about to start raining (the first rain i would see so far on my trip). i looked down to wipe off any obvious water drops from my shirt. at that moment i realized i was wearing my “phrolic” tshirt with my dad’s face on it. how appropriate!\n\nlooking down to wipe my hand along my chest to knock off spilled water, i stopped and started laughing. the water drops look like two teardrops from my dad’s eyes. i shit you not! now if i was a religious man, i would see this as a sure sign from the afterlife. and i know some of you reading this will assure me later that it was! but i took it as a comical coincidence that honestly, my dad would have thoroughly loved.\n\n![](https://gowithbflow.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/img_4167.jpg?w=473)\n\n> don’t cry over spilt water\n\n```\nstory time! before my oldest sibling sara was born, my mom and dad had a miscarriage. naturally, they didn’t think that they would be able to get pregnant as a result. my dad claimed he had 3 dreams where the blessed mother came to him and told him “fear not paddy, you will have a beautiful daughter. and you will name her sara.” he wrote those dreams down on a piece of paper, sealed it in an envelope, and kept it forever. as you are aware, they did indeed have a daughter, and they named her sara. he added some flair by making her middle name maria, in honor of mary. my dad had always felt a special connection to the blessed mother. a few years before he passed, he started to give away his possessions. he wanted to be there to watch us receive his treasures (his scab collection, his shrunken head, his vinyl collection… all the good stuff). it’s more fun to watch your collections be cherished by someone new than to sit stuffed in a box. especially something as meaningful as his sealed dreams, which he gave to sara and she still has yet to unseal to this day.\n```\n\nit started drizzling, so i quickly packed everything and threw on my raincoat. i started walking back to the hotel. it rained for only about 10 minutes.\n\nwhen i got back to the hotel, i soaked my legs again. they still weren’t feeling right. but the pain was tolerable. later that night i headed out to the only other bar in town that was open, o’connor’s. what a difference it was than the one last night. as i’m walking in, a limo bus pulls up. i hear a bar employee say “oh yer that rugby players innit?” he was. who that was, i don’t know. i continue walking in and the bartender asks “are you with the wedding?” oh boy! here we go!\n\nit was a monday night, so i was surprised a wedding party would be arriving. it was 3 buses of irish, from 12 years old to 80 years old.\n\n“is the whole place rented for a private event?” i asked, seeing if i needed to sneak in.\n\n“nope, have a seat at the bar!” with pleasure! if i know irish weddings, i knew i was about to meet some people at what would be the busiest place in the building that night.\n\nthe bride’s sister was the first to come up. the bride and groom have been together for 15 years, but he finally popped the question so this was going to be “a BIG celebration.” she asked to do a shot with me, so of course i obliged with a hearty slainte. the bartender told me that the families rented out ballybeg house, a short way down the road. i wonder if i passed it on my walk to the well. this place does many a fancy wedding, and you have to rent the entire place out for 3 or 4 day affairs, usually a couple years ahead of time. they usually do at least 2 weddings a week, he said. having attended mick and ann marie’s 4 day fest, this wasn’t a terrible surprise to me. this was the pre-celebration, with the wedding the following night (tuesday). i found that rather interesting. i’ve never been to a tuesday wedding, but the ballybeg house sounded like an economic engine for this small village in county wicklow.\n\ni met two of the brothers of the groom. the first came up to me “are ye irish?” “nope, american.” “hah, i win. he’s not.” they had bet if i was irish or a tourist. they actually both have lived in nashville, tennessee for the last 10 years. i commented “oh wow you still have your accents!” the older brother replied “i come back often. i hafta keep me accent. it’s how i get tha girls!” i met the father of the groom, who seemed to be paying for the open bar. incredibly gregarious and grateful for the turnout. and i met the youngest guy at the bar who shyly asked the bartender for “a schmirnof ice. BUT it’s not for me. i’m prankin’ me father.” the bartender laughed, didn’t mind his prepubescence, and gave him the ice. i watched him sneak it under his dad’s seat, and when he returned from the bathroom, asked his dad to grab something he dropped under his seat. ICED! his dad had to chug the rather disgusting drink. man, i hadn’t see that in years and had a good chuckle. the son was laughing hysterically. i met some friends of the bride and friends of the groom, many of whom started the conversation with “yer the yank, huh?” or “yer the guy from philly, yeah?” by the number of people that offered me a shot (i only did a couple with the bridal party members), i could tell the wedding would be a fun time.\n\n![](https://gowithbflow.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/img_4169.jpg?w=768)\n\n> this soup course took me back to 2003, my first time in ireland. when all i could afford was soup. i’ll still contend that ireland makes some of the best soups i’ve ever had. this one was superb.\n\nbetween meeting wedding goers, i had a fabulous meal and discussion with the two bartenders, oisín and aoife. oisin was a young irish guy, born in puerto rico, lived in panama, but mostly has lived in every area of ireland. he has an american passport but has never been to america since his toddler years in puerto rico, even tho his sister lives near lake tahoe in california. aoife was a gorgeous young irish girl, with a charming smile and a very thick accent. her eyes twinkled when she smiled. she has lived here her whole life. both gave me their suggestions about where i should go (connemara and the ring of kerry seemed to be consensus. “perfect! that’s where my trip ends!”) both said the last leg of the wicklow way was the worst, because it’s on a lot of roads. but neither had done it for themselves, so i ignored that. aoife “couldn’t be caught dead” drinking water from random sources. “what are ye, mental?” oisin wasn’t into hiking, and would rather play football. when i asked why no one in the wedding party was drinking guinness, but instead drank heineken, oisin said “let me put this in terms ye’d understand. yer in red neck country! we have no taste.”\n\ni was glad i stayed in tinahely a second night. my impressions of it changed rather quickly when i actually was in a better mood myself, and when i sat and talked to the lifeblood of the town. this is the kind of town i really enjoy visiting. i feel like you get a much better taste of irish culture here than from dublin or cork or killarney. it’s not that i don’t also love the bigger cities, but i feel like a lot of times in those cities, you end up meeting americans or other travelers — when what i’m here for is the irish.\n\nthe wedding pre-party was slowing down, saving their energy for the big night i guess. either that or the open bar was closing and they’d head back to drink at ballybeg house. so with that, i also settled up and started to head back to the hotel myself. my lower leg was starting to throb, and i wanted to give it ample rest before a long trek tomorrow. as i was leaving, the brothers said “if yer in the area tomorrow, crash the weddin!” i considered staying again in tinahely. but i only had 2 change of clothes total for my trip, and neither hiking pants or hiking shorts are wedding-worthy. and both were getting stinky. the next laundromat or male’s clothing store were miles away. “i will!” i lied. “have a blast! and congrats!” i throw back the rest of my guinness.\n\nmy glass was empty but *my cup&#x20;*&#x77;as full.\n\n![](https://gowithbflow.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/img_4174.jpg?w=1024)\n\n> 10:30 pm 🤷‍♂️\n\nit was roughly 10:30pm when i left the bar. and it was still dusk lighting. that throws me for a loop every time. goodnight tinahely, thanks for giving me a break and letting my tired legs recover.\n\n\\#travel #ireland2022\n",

      "summary": "SERIES REPOST 2022: day four (~21 miles; ~73 total) pushed me to my limit — no coffee, scarce water, and a grueling final descent into tinahely. between a fox at dawn, worms in my rainwater, and aching legs begging for mercy, i learned that sometimes survival looks like a hot soak, a burger, and a well-earned pint.",
      "content": "> *\\[ Edited: 10/25/2025 this is a repost of a series i wrote in 2022, migrating it to the new nostr website ]*\n\n**DAY FOUR HIKE:** \\~21 miles\\\n**TOTAL HIKE:** \\~73 miles\n\ni made a cardinal sin last night. i didn’t put my phone into airplane mode. being half way down a valley, the reception was non-existent in the hut. the phone searched all night for better coverage, and when i awoke it was half way drained. eek!\n\ni took out the power bank and carried it and the phone together, sandwiched together while i brought new life to the phone. this power bank feels like it’s 1.5 or 2 pounds (it’s a big battery for 2 full phone charges in case i needed it). carrying it while hiking is awkward and adds strain to my hand. but i didn’t want to wait at camp for it to charge. the town of glenmalure is a short distance ahead, i would get breakfast there and hope i could put the charger away after. so for the first day i don’t have my coffee and set off at around 7:30am.\n\ni am feeling great. feeling strong. ready for a marathon of a day to knock some mileage out and see some more beautiful landscapes. as i turn around the first bend in the road, headed down further into the valley to glenmalure, a fox runs across the trail, taking me by surprise. another hundred meters down the road, and a big buck is grazing on a berry bush and we scare each other. active morning in the woods!\n\ni arrive at glenmalure at around 8am. and the restaurant/pub that’s on my map is not yet open. this place looks fun (live music!) and if i knew it was this close, i may have tempted coming down from the hut for a beer and trad music session (but leaving my bag would have been stupid?).\n\nwell shoot, that was the only water source on the map (“fill at pub”) in a couple mile radius. i was banking on them! i look outside to see if there’s a tap at all, as i had seen at one or two small farms along the way. a small tap with a worn and weathered hand written “drinking water” sign on it. very gracious to the farmers when i see those.\n\nalas, nothing. no breakfast. no water. no coffee. so i keep walking, with the clunky power brick in hand. i continue the trek and eventually see the private campground that was option 2 for last night after the hut. it’s behind a locked fence. glad i didn’t pass up the empty hut! i continue up the forest path. shortly thereafter, tmy ears perk up. running water!\n\nthere’s something so very primal about the sound of running water. even when i was full, and deep in thought, the sound of running water would snap me out of my head and back into reality. y*ou need water to survive. do you have enough?&#x20;*&#x74;hank you, primal instincts. no, i do not have enough this morning. i wiggle through the first couple feet of dense trees and find a nice stream of clear water. there’s also a clearing of flat land. i marked both the water source and the potential wild camp site on the hiiker map for to next person debating how far they can make it to their next campsite.\n\nthe next couple mile trek took me back up into the clouds with some nice views along the way. several parts were on the road with bicyclists whizzing by. i couldn’t imagine going at the speed they were going: both up and downhill. my initial idea for this trip was biking the wild atlantic way, 1600 miles long the western coast. it’s amazing scenery… but seeing all these hills and mountains, i’m sure glad i didn’t pursue that. plus, i like walking way more than i like biking.\n\n![](https://gowithbflow.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/img_4085.jpg?w=1024)\n\n> aghavannagh, so remote that inhabitants say it “is the last place god made”\n\ni saw a bunch of people the last couple of days. so far today, i’ve seen no one. as i’m climbing down a boulder path, a long way down, wide enough for one person, i jump at the sound of footsteps behind me. i didn’t hear him coming, but an irish runner was *running* down this boulder path! what!? how!? it was rather impressive. he takes out his ear buds,\n\n“hiya! i see yer pack, you doing the whole way?”\n\n“yep! trying to do the coast to coast actually!”\n\n“that’s great! where did ye stay last night.”\n\n“just outside glenmalure in that hut.”\n\n“was it clean? people are arseholes and leave trash a lot.”\n\n“it was perfect!”\n\n“you made good time. what time did you start, half six?”\n\n“about 7:30. i’m about to stop for lunch.”\n\n“carry on! good luck!”\n\nand he sped up and left my field of vision in seconds. impressive.\n\n![](https://gowithbflow.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/img_4088.jpg?w=1024)\n\n> still carrying that charger. awkward! nicest of the huts!\n\ni arrived at the last hut on the trail. it was about a 7 mile hike in 2 1/2 hours. but it was pretty hot and i drank most of the 2L water. i read this hut had a rain water collection tank on the side, so i tested to make sure it had water in it. turned it on quickly, felt lots of pressure, turned it off. great! so i chugged the rest of what i had in the camelback and half the hydro flask. then i opened a granola and berries meal pack, used the rest of the water to rehydrate it and to make some coffee. i’m sitting at the hut and notice the guest book so i crack it open. lots of entries from families thankful for the place to stay. lots of couples doing weekend hikes. lots doing the whole of wicklow way. lots of people, like me, using it as a place to eat lunch. someone stayed here each of the last 4 beautiful weather nights. i used the broken pen to write a little note and leave encouragement for the next person to read it. i mention the ashes i have been dropping along the route, and how i stayed in the hut outside of glenmalure. “i will keep an eye out if you raise money to build more huts!”.\n\n![](https://gowithbflow.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/img_4086.jpg?w=768)\n\n> the guest book has seen better days! almost every page in the book was filled up.\n\ni’m still hungry. i didn’t eat dinner last night because i went to bed early. so i figure i’ll make another food pack. i opted for the pesto chicken pasta. i just needed to refill water.\n\ni head to the rain collector. water gushes out into my hydro flask. i look in and there are a lot of floaties. i def wish i brought a filter. i used the fabric of a shirt i wasn’t wearing to cover the mouth of the hydro flask. and pour the water into the stove pot to boil it.\n\ni looked at the fabric after pouring and almost gagged. there were small larva or worms wiggling around on the shirt. maybe a half inch long each. gross. and i just drank all my water! (i didn’t get a picture) well, i boiled the heck out of the strained water. made my pasta pack, which was surpassingly good. and i drank the remainder of the boiled 1/2 liter as hot water. i was not keen on the idea of filling up water with the worms again. so i left my tanks empty and hoped for the best. i basically just ate/drank 3 liters so i should be fine.\n\nbefore i left, i tried to figure out lodging. i screwed the pooch (that saying is… weird) with the airplane mode snafu and now i drained my backup battery. so i needed to find a b\\&b or hotel. i couldn’t find much available but about 14 miles away was a small town of tinahely, about a mile and half off the trail. that looked good. i checked the [booking.com](http://booking.com) app and they had a room available. and the room had a bathtub for a soak. BINGO. booked it for €140. expensive but whatever, helping the irish economy! now to get 14 miles with no water. easy peazy.\n\nhttps://blossom.primal.net/5e3b1f00ff8d7cb7f0d581fe3a61085a7dbe87eca8d1f722d878d5edc9e6365d.mp4\n\n> i think dad would find it insulting to say this is a black horse. but that’s why it made me laugh. i’m the hospital, my dad said he would return as a black horse (in havertown) so that’s kinda become his symbol. and yes, i pet the horse after i turned off the camera haha.\n\n![](https://gowithbflow.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/img_4093.jpg?w=697)\n\n> lots of wind, lots of windmills. go ireland!\n\nhttps://blossom.primal.net/13c7e7fcbd780400b279e8383a0b9e43800f397c0b50f63ad2c096b42e9951d5.mp4\n\n![](https://gowithbflow.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/img_4092.jpg?w=768)\n\n> loved the light in the forest, pictures never do it justice\n\n![](https://gowithbflow.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/img_4105.jpg?w=1024)\n\n> just me and more sheep.\n\nhttps://blossom.primal.net/5aaec300dc19bd472bb1fe895e831363041c6e724e0d31369fdd6dfe5c5a36c1.mp4\n\n> soaking it all in\n\n![](https://gowithbflow.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/img_4114.jpg?w=1024)\n\n> majestic af\n\n![](https://gowithbflow.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/img_4118.jpg?w=1024)\n\n> i’m probably the only person they saw today\n\nhttps://blossom.primal.net/e91afa2dc04cc9ec9964aa0d8a42ff970d5600c8232d5dcd6a1c0b77881d2bcf.mp4\n\n> my walk gets rudely interrupted by an irish traffic jam. i tried to talk to these guys but only got a “how are ye.” they were busy and i was tired. so i kept going after the jam cleared out.\n\nthis leg of the hike was grueling, particularly the last few miles. i was at close to 20 miles with lots of downhill on hard road and lots of uphill on slick sheep shit. it was grueling. i was getting emotionally and physically drained. i came to a junction point. and could have gotten to town two different ways. one went up. the other went down. clearly i took the down route, hoping it was mostly down into the valley. i didn’t think i could make it another ascent, literally. my legs were sore. my feet were exploding out of sides of my boots. i needed water badly. (i had refilled at a stream since the hut, and drank 3 L but i needed more by this point and was bone dry again).\n\nfeeling completely drained, i think i let out an audible whimper and a whiny “whyyy…” when i saw i had to climb a fence. i took my time, careful not to fall over from exhaustion. 1.5 miles more. 1.5 miles until a hot soak in a tub. 1.3 miles more. 1.3 miles until a hot meal and a beer. 1 mile more. man this road is not ending. *1.5 miles… that’s about 10 minutes at my fast running pace. why am i only going 100 feet in 10 minutes.*\n\ni stopped half way down in front of a young family’s house to rest. my feet felt as if i had walked on sharp glass all day. and the hard asphalt was not helping. i took off my bag, sat on a rock for a couple a minutes and wondered out loud “i think this pace is unsustainable. at least with me carrying this fooker the whole way.” i kick mr. osprey and he falls over. ugh. i loosen my shoelaces a bit. when i do this i realize i’m not wearing my hiking socks. i’m still wearing my post-hike campsite compression socks. maybe this is why my feet feel particularly bad today? i have never had shin splints before but i start to feel a pain in my shins. that’s something to watch for, i think to myself.\n\na young woman comes out of the house, gets into her car, waves a friendly hello. *please offer me a ride the last mile!* *please!&#x20;*&#x6F;utwardly i was smiling and waving back, but i must have had a hardened scowl on my face, one of agony and grit. because she just drove away without opening her passenger door!\n\na mile… i got this. i picked up my bag, threw it over my back, and did the old man shuffle down the rest of the hill, moving my feet barely off the ground and going 10 inches at a time. it did the trick.\n\ntinahely is a small village with a population under 1000 people. but they had everything i needed to, as i had decided on that last painful descent, take a day off tomorrow and rest. my legs needed it. my shoulders needed it. my spirit and well-being needed it. it was the most trying day so far, but the hike was as gorgeous as the day was long. exploring the town will have to wait until tomorrow. i have a hot soak, a burger, and a beer to attend to!\n\n![](https://gowithbflow.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/img_4123.jpg?w=1024)\n\n> my well earned burger, the irish beef is from the farm attached to the restaurant! i got fried egg and irish bacon on top of the burger, because protein and calories and mmmmm.\n\n\\#travel #ireland2022\n",

They unpack President Trump’s viral post urging ranchers to lower beef prices and the backlash from cattle producers who point to low herd size, packer settlements, and market volatility driven by political posts. Then they dig into the looming SNAP crunch amid the government shutdown, how an AWS outage jammed up harvest logistics and farmgate payments, and the partial reopening of FSA offices to process $3B in producer payments—plus the real-world cash flow pinch for beginning farmers. JR also delivers the Bitcoin Land Price Report, shares why he’s bullish on both land and Bitcoin, and explains practical resiliency lessons from a payments outage.

      "content": "In this episode, Vance Crowe sits down with author Devon Erickson to explore why he calls himself a compulsive explainer and how he sees the role of an intellectual: not to end debates, but to start them with powerful metaphors and fresh lenses. They dive deep into empathy as a writer’s core skill—simultaneously inhabiting a character’s inner world and anticipating the reader’s experience—and how that practice shapes Devon’s science-fiction novel, Theft of Fire. From first-person perspective and memory palaces to the mechanics of metaphor in thought, they wander into bigger terrain: how online discourse reveals public preoccupations, why villains must believe they’re right, and what it takes to write convincingly across gender and worldview.\n\nTheir conversation also ranges into contested civic ground: the difference between empathy and sympathy, the dynamics of thug mentality and civilized restraint, the risks of escalating political tribalism, and the notion of “soft off-ramps” in American politics. They talk about immigration enforcement as theater versus necessity, institutional capture, and the appeal of centralized control to academics. Then they zoom back to the personal: metabolic health and processed food, the economic pressures on families, inflation as time theft, Bitcoin as an intergenerational lifeboat, and why some boomers feel out of touch with younger realities. They close with Devon’s passion project—the cinematic, full-cast audiobook of Theft of Fire—and the promise of classic sci-fi spirit with modern tech rigor.\n\nLegacy Interviews - A service that records individuals and couples telling their life stories so that future generations can know their family history. https://www.legacyinterviews.com/experience (https://www.legacyinterviews.com/experience)\n\nRiver.com - Invest in Bitcoin with Confidence https://river.com/signup?r=OAB5SKTP (https://river.com/signup?r=OAB5SKTP)\n\nto support the show and buy Bitcoin use the link to our show sponsor River.com https://river.com/invite?r=OAB5SKTP (https://river.com/invite?r=OAB5SKTP)\n\n(00:00:04) Opening: Sharing insights vs. repeating talking points\n\n(00:03:11) Host intro: Meeting Devon Erickson and The Theft of Fire\n\n(00:06:12) Metaphor as the engine of thought and memory\n\n(00:14:44) Empathy as a writer’s core skill—villains, readers, and realism\n\n(00:19:59) Modeling minds: conversational load, perspective taking, and audiences\n\n(00:26:06) Writing across gender and identity—finding Miranda’s voice\n\n(00:29:08) Speculative craft: writing what does not exist\n\n(00:30:04) Online discourse: empathy without sympathy and confronting hostility\n\n(00:36:55) Self‑defense mindset: lines, intent, and preparedness\n\n(00:41:49) Civility, uncivil actors, and the ‘soft off‑ramp’ in politics\n\n(00:49:31) Purpose of a military and cultural standards debate\n\n(00:51:58) Media narratives, ICE, and dealing with the uncivilized\n\n(01:02:00) Marxism, envy, and institutions—power vs. merit\n\n(01:11:55) Inflation’s danger and policy priorities ahead\n\n(01:14:16) Immigration, budget crises, and administration choices\n\n(01:14:32) Foreign influence and defining America’s interests\n\n(01:18:14) Money tech: inflation, Bitcoin, and future‑proofing exchange\n\n(01:21:15) Order vs. chaos: El Salvador, gangs, and state response\n\n(01:37:07) Feminism, industrialized food, and metabolic syndrome\n\n(01:46:33) What causes the obesity wave?

      "summary": "... damit habe ich nichts zu tun, deswegen interessiert mich das Thema auch nicht ...",
      "content": "“*Dieser Beitrag wurde mit dem* *[Pareto-Client](https://pareto.space/read)* *geschrieben.”*\n\n&#x20;\n\n \n\nTrauma (1)\n\n…  damit habe ich nichts zu tun, deswegen interessiert mich das Thema auch nicht …\n\n\n\n„ … und ich habe davon auch gar keine Ahnung … das ist ein Thema für Ärzte und Therapeuten … Trauma haben andere… ich habe kein Trauma … die Kriegsgeneration hatte ein Trauma … ich hab so etwas nicht … wir sind ja im Frieden aufgewachsen … wir hatten es doch gut … über das Thema wird schon viel zu viel geredet … jeder möchte heute am liebsten traumatisiert sein … ich finde das irgendwie übertrieben … bei jeder Kleinigkeit sagen die Leute heute, sie seien traumatisiert … mir geht es gut … ich habe keine Probleme … was soll denn das überhaupt sein, ein Trauma?“\n\n \n\nEin Video über Weltfrieden, und wie man diesen erreichen könne, hat mich vor ein paar Tagen auf die Idee gebracht, eine weitere Reihe von Artikeln zu beginnen. Das wird eine Reihe rund um das Thema  **TRAUMA**  sein, denn nur Menschen, denen ihr eigenes Trauma (ihr eigener Schmerz) nicht bewusst ist, erlauben, unterstützen oder führen Kriege.    Menschen, denen ihr Trauma hingegen bewusst ist und die nach einiger Zeit wieder Zugang zum gesamten Gefühlsspektrum haben (auch zum eigenen Schmerz), führen keine Kriege mehr, egal wo. Wenn man Schmerz fühlen kann, dann führt man keine Kriege mehr, weil es einen selber schmerzen würde. Trauma spaltet den Schmerz ab. Das ist das Problem. Man ist dann buchstäblich „schmerzfrei“ und kann Dinge tun, zu denen andere gar nicht in der Lage wären. Wie kann man nun über etwas reden, was abgespalten ist, was man nicht spürt, was im Prinzip nicht vorhanden ist? Hier ein Versuch.\n\nDenn Reden über Trauma ist für mich die Voraussetzung für echten Frieden.\n\n \n\n* ***BEWUSSTSEIN UND DAS GANZE GEFÜHLSSPEKTRUM***\n\nWenn man über Frieden redet, dann sollte man also auch über Trauma reden.\n\n**BEWUSSTSEIN** kann man schaffen, indem man viel über Trauma redet.\n\nAber es muss echtes Reden sein, aus dem eigenen Herzen.\n\nUnd jeder redet ein bisschen anders über (sein) Trauma.\n\n**DAS WIEDERERLANGEN DES GESAMTEN GEFÜHLSSPEKTRUMS**  ist schon etwas schwieriger zu erreichen als das bloße Bewusstwerden, dass da ein Trauma ist. Aber es ist definitiv möglich, wenn man entschlossen ist, den ganzen langen Weg zu gehen, den es dafür braucht.\n\n**NATÜRLICHE SELBSTHEILUNGSKRÄFTE**  helfen hierbei ganz entscheidend.\n\n \n\n* ***DAS MUSTER VON TRAUMA***\n\nDas Traumathema ist mein Hobby, war mein Beruf. Erst spät habe ich mein eigenes Trauma entdeckt, und noch etwas später konnte ich es bearbeiten und integrieren. Zwischen Entdecken und Bearbeitung lagen 20 Jahre. Wenn man selbst ein Trauma bearbeitet hat, dann schaut man anders auf die Menschen und die Welt. Man erkennt Muster, die andere Menschen theoretisch aus Büchern lernen müssen, innerhalb von Sekunden, weil man das alles am eigenen Leib erfahren hat. Man erkennt Trauma bei anderen. Man sieht, wo und auf welchem Level jemand steht. Man erkennt missbräuchliche Strukturen in der näheren Umgebung. Man erkennt diese Muster im Beruflichen, in Institutionen, in der Politik. Wie im Kleinen, so im Großen. Es ist immer das gleiche Muster. Man kann aber kaum mit jemandem darüber reden, weil niemand etwas mit dem Traumathema zu tun haben möchte. Die meisten Menschen versuchen, es sich nicht anmerken zu lassen, wenn sie irgendwo hautnah Täterstrukturen wahrnehmen. Das ist eine kluge Taktik, die es einem erlaubt zu flüchten oder zumindest nicht selbst zur Zielscheibe des Täters zu werden. Wer den Täter benennt, ist Zielscheibe. Täter scheuen das Licht wie Vampire. Täter scheuen breite Öffentlichkeit, denn dann hört der Spuk sofort auf. Deswegen werden in Deutschland auch Versammlungen und Demonstrationen nicht gern gesehen. In dem Moment, wo sich viele Menschen einig sind, können Repräsentanten keine Lügen mehr aufrechterhalten. Sie verlieren ihre Macht.\n\nEin Problem der letzten Jahre ist sicherlich, dass viele Menschen die Täterstrukturen zwar erkannt haben, aber an Ort und Stelle den Mund gehalten haben, an Arbeitsplätzen, in Behörden, in Geschäften, in Arztpraxen, in Kindergärten, in Schulen, in Altenheimen. An anderer Stelle wurde dann um so mehr geredet, analysiert, demonstriert oder konsequent geleugnet, bewusst oder unbewusst. Das ist kein Vorwurf, sondern nur eine Beobachtung. Bei einer Grenzüberschreitung den Mund zu halten, ist gelerntes Verhalten. Wie oft und wie lange wir Grenzüberschreitung mit uns machen lassen, sagt etwas darüber aus, wie oft wir Grenzüberschreitungen bereits im Vorfeld hinnehmen mussten und hingenommen haben. Manche Menschen haben Schwierigkeiten, Grenzüberschreitungen überhaupt wahrzunehmen. Andere haben ein Problem damit, das eigene Bedürfnis, was sehr wohl wahrgenommen werden kann, zu äußern bzw. durchzusetzen. Wieder andere haben ein Problem damit, dies angemessen zu äußern bzw. durchzusetzen. Manche Menschen streiten die Grenzüberschreitung generell ab und stellen sich sofort auf die Seite des Täters. Manche Menschen tun dies unbewusst und reflexartig, andere tun dies in arglistiger Weise. Alles das ist gelerntes Verhalten und Ausdruck von vorhergehender Traumatisierung, die meist früh im Leben stattgefunden hat. Menschen erzählen über Verhalten ihre alte Geschichte.\n\n \n\n* ***ZEBRAS,  GIRAFFEN  UND  LÖWEN***\n\nMenschen sind mitunter wie Zebras. Wenn sich ein Löwe einer Gruppe Zebras annähert, dann zeigen sich sie Huftiere zunächst scheinbar unbeeindruckt. Sie entfernen sich ganz langsam und unauffällig vom Löwen. Erst, wenn sie einen gewissen Abstand erreicht haben, galoppieren sie und flüchten.\n\nMenschen können aber auch konfrontativ, verteidigend und beschützend sein wie eine Giraffe. Giraffen verteidigen sich mit ihren langen Beinen und den schlagkräftigen Hufen gegen Löwen. Der sensible Hals liegt zu weit oben. Löwen haben wenige Chancen, eine Giraffe zu erlegen.\n\nLöwen leben davon, dass sie die Schwächen in der Abwehr der Gruppe erkennen. Da, wo die Gruppe nicht zusammen hält, greift der Löwe ein einzelnes Tier an.\n\n**Bei nicht verarbeitetem Trauma** sind die **natürlichen Abwehrmechanismen des Einzelnen** gegen neue Verletzungen **geschwächt**, weshalb traumatisierte Menschen leichter erneut Opfer werden als andere. Rote Flaggen werden nicht gesehen oder falsch interpretiert. Die eigene Stärke wird unterschätzt. Menschen lassen sich manipulieren, werden Mitläufer, sehen subjektiv keinen anderen Ausweg. Löwen erlegen am Ende die jungen, geschwächten oder vorverletzten Tiere einer Gruppe.\n\n**Befindet sich das Trauma hingegen auf einer bewussten Ebene, wird bearbeitet oder ist gar integriert**, dann können Angriffe oder Manipulationsversuche **besser abgewehrt werden**. Man versucht das „Unmögliche“, weil man weiß, dass das auch eine Strategie ist, die man im Notfall wählen kann oder sogar muss. Man hat diese Erfahrung des Überlebens bereits einmal gemacht und ist dadurch im Glauben an die eigenen Kräfte gestärkt worden. Das Zebra erkennt die Gefahr (wieder) und kann auch mit einer langsamen Gangart im Schutz der bewussten Gruppe flüchten. Kein Löwe greift gern eine ganze Gruppe an. **Der Glaube an das Unmögliche ist manchmal wichtiger als das Lauftempo. Eine ganze Gruppe, die an das Unmögliche glaubt, ist kaum zu besiegen.**\n\n** **\n\n* ***GENERATIONENTRAUMA  BEDEUTET  BINDUNGSTRAUMA    (die Bindung zwischen den Generationen ist durch den Krieg/ die Kriege gestört worden)***\n\nIn Deutschland ist den meisten Menschen ihr Trauma nicht bewusst, so meine Einschätzung. Das sogenannte **kollektive Trauma/ Generationentrauma** geistert zwar durch die Medien, aber die wenigsten wissen bei näherem Nachfragen, was dies bedeuten soll. Es ist für viele zu einem Synonym für die direkt oder indirekt gemachten Kriegserfahrungen und Entbehrungen der älteren Generation geworden, aber die in Verlust geratenen Gefühle dazu werden nicht thematisiert, nicht erinnert, weil sie abgespalten bleiben, obwohl man das Buch über Generationentrauma im Regal stehen hat.\n\nDeshalb ist auch vielen Menschen der Geburtenjahrgänge ab 1960/1970 heute in Deutschland ihr **Bindungstrauma** nicht bewusst. Was der Mutter nicht bewusst ist, ist auch der Tochter nicht bewusst. Frauen (und Männer), die direkt den Krieg erlebt haben, und später Kinder bekamen, erzogen diese Kinder mit den Gefühlen, die ihnen zur Verfügung standen. Oftmals war das aber nicht das ganze Gefühlsspektrum. Tiefer Schmerz, tiefe Trauer oder Wut konnten/durften nicht gefühlt werden, weil diese Gefühle im Krieg schockartig abgespalten werden mussten. Angst vor Not und Mangel, entstand durch tatsächlich erlebten Mangel, war später ein ständiger Begleiter, ein Selbstläufer, obwohl die Wirtschaft nach dem 2. Weltkrieg florierte. Mütter und Väter blieben, ohne es zu merken, im Traumamodus hängen. Kinder dieser Mütter, auch ich bin solch ein Kind, durften Wut, Trauer, Schmerz entsprechend auch nicht fühlen. Angst bezog sich später bei meiner Generation weniger auf materiellen Wohlstand bzw. dessen Verlust, sondern mehr darauf, beruflich erfolgreich sein und Wissen anhäufen zu müssen. Versagensängste/Leistungsängste liefen der Angst vor Not und Mangel den Rang ab. Eine Ellenbogengesellschaft entstand. Die Grundangst, irgendetwas nicht zu schaffen, Mangel befürchten zu müssen, blieb. Diese Kinder hatten im Prinzip das gleiche defizitäre Gefühlsleben wie ihre Eltern. Mir persönlich war das lange nicht bewusst. Wenn man Karriere machen wollte, dann musste man sich Ärger verkneifen, Trauer kam nicht gut an oder verminderte die Leistungsfähigkeit und Schmerz hielt man aus. Versagensängste trieben Menschen in die Perfektion und in\\`s Burnout. Das zugrunde liegende Bindungstrauma ist den meisten Menschen meiner Generation, so meine Beobachtung, nicht bewusst. Und die Probleme, die aus Bindungstrauma entstehen, gelten heute als normal, weil viele Menschen diese (emotionalen) Probleme privat wie beruflich haben. Menschen leben lange allein, haben wechselnde Partner oder ständig Streit innerhalb der stabilen Beziehung. Nicht jeder Streit wird kommuniziert. Manchmal brechen Partnerschaften auch nach 20 Jahren ohne einen Streit „einfach so“ auseinander.\n\n**Bindungstrauma wirkt in alle Lebensbereiche, nicht nur in den partnerschaftlichen Bereich.**\n\nBindungstrauma bedeutet nicht, dass die Mutter einen nicht geliebt hat, denn jede Mutter liebt ihr Kind. Bindungstrauma bedeutet, dass Mütter (und Väter) durch den Krieg seelisch so geschockt und verletzt worden sind, dass es ihnen später schwer fiel, sich emotional wieder voll und ganz auf ihr Kind einzulassen, es mit seinen Emotionen sehen und spüren zu können. Die Emotionen des Kindes triggerten das an, was bei den Eltern unter Verschluss gehalten werden musste. Konflikte waren somit vorprogrammiert.\n\nEs gibt viele weitere Arten von Trauma, aber Bindungstrauma ist weit verbreitet, weil Menschen meiner Generation Mütter und Väter hatten, die den Krieg mit all seinen schrecklichen Folgen als Kind miterlebt und in der Regel nicht bewusst aufgearbeitet haben.\n\n \n\n**Das Reden über Bindungstrauma ist somit keine Anklage von Eltern, sondern ein Brechen des Schweigens über stattgefundenes Trauma.**\n\n**Schweigen ist ein Merkmal von Trauma.**\n\n**Reden über Trauma bedeutet Bewusstwerdung und letztlich eine Wiederkehr des gesamten Gefühlsspektrums.**\n\n**Eine Gesellschaft braucht fühlende Menschen.**\n\n**Reden über Trauma ist Friedensarbeit.**\n\n**Und Schmerz ist der Preis für dieses Reden.**\n\n**Und manchmal ist auch Trennung der Preis für das Reden über Trauma.**\n\n**Am Ende bringt die Bearbeitung von Trauma aber immer die Liebe ins Leben zurück.**\n\n**Und Liebe hilft anderen bei deren Traumabearbeitung, damit auch sie wieder fühlende Menschen werden.**\n\n**Liebe ist im Prinzip nur ein anderes Wort für Frieden.**\n\n** **\n\n* ***DEFINITION  VON  TRAUMA  ALS  IMPULS  ZUM  NACHDENKEN***\n\nTrauma bedeutet ganz allgemein, zu wenig Gefühl, zu viel Gefühl, die richtigen Gefühle an der falschen Stelle, ständig wechselnde Gefühle, Probleme mit NEIN sagen, Probleme mit JA sagen, immer wieder das nehmen, was man kennt, um dann wieder enttäuscht zu sein, Kopf und Herz nicht im Einklang zu haben, Wiederholungszwang, Dinge vom Kopf her verstehen, aber nicht fühlen können, das eigene Problem nicht sehen können, aber immer das Problem beim anderen sehen können, Angst vor Erfolg, Angst vorm Scheitern, Schuldgefühle, obwohl man nichts falsch gemacht hat, fehlende Schuldgefühle, obwohl sie angebracht wären, Scham für das Sosein, wie man ist, andere zu beschämen, das unbewusst mit anderen zu machen, was einem selbst zugefügt wurde, Unsicherheit über den eigenen Wert bewusst zu haben oder zu leugnen, zu kleine oder zu große Erwartungen an sich selbst oder an andere zu stellen, Versuche, die Unsicherheit über den eigenen Wert dysfunktional zu kompensieren, Angst vor Ablehnung und deswegen vorsichtshalber andere abzulehnen, Angst davor, gemocht zu werden, weil das irgendwann auch wieder aufhören könnte, fehlende Trennungskompetenz, ewig an jemandem festzuhalten, sich alles gefallen zu lassen, oder den anderen kontrollieren zu wollen, unersetzlich sein zu wollen, Probleme, Komplimente anzunehmen, eigene Bedürfnisse zu äußern oder auch mal deutlich durchzusetzen, wenn dies angebracht ist, Probleme, Kritik zu äußern, Probleme, negative oder positive Gefühle überhaupt zeigen zu können, Probleme, selber sichtbar zu sein, weil das Verantwortungsübernahme bedeutet, Probleme, anderen Anerkennung und Lob zu schenken, weil der andere dann zu stark für mich werden könnte, mich verlassen könnte, Probleme, andere mit ihren Gefühlen wahrzunehmen und auszuhalten, weil das eigene verborgene Wünsche und Bedürfnisse triggert, Probleme, die eigenen Gefühle komplett wahrzunehmen und auszuhalten, weil sich das wie Sterben anfühlt. Die Liste ist unendlich. Es ist immer ein Zuviel oder ein Zuwenig, und das hochgerechnet mit sich allein und mit allen Interaktionspartnern an 365 Tagen im Jahr.\n\n \n\n**Reden über Trauma ist die Voraussetzung für wirklich friedliche Gefühle.**\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n“*Dieser Beitrag wurde mit dem* *[Pareto-Client](https://pareto.space/read)* *geschrieben.”*\n\n \n\n**Sie sind noch nicht auf** [Nostr](https://nostr.com/) **and wollen die volle Erfahrung machen (liken, kommentieren etc.)?

      "title": "Zur Zeit #01: Das Gute (er)finden",
      "summary": "Was mich zurzeit bewegt vom 25.10.25. Von Michael Karjalainen-Dräger",
      "content": "Nun ist es soweit. Ausgabe #01 meiner neuen Kolumne „Zur Zeit“ erblickt das Licht der Welt. Und wie es der Obmann von Idealism Prevails, Hermann Böhm, der die gleichnamige unabhängige Medienplattform betreibt, für die ich rund ein Jahr lang Chefredakteur war und bei der ich weiterhin in der Redaktion an Bord bin, so treffend ausgedrückt hat, ist es tatsächlich wieder einmal Zeit, mich neu zu erfinden. Es gilt in Zeiten wie diesen, in denen Alarmismus und Perspektivenlosigkeit herrschen und die Maßnahmen hervorbringen, die gerne als „alternativlos“ bezeichnet werden, einen Kontrapunkt zu setzen. Wenn das Gute nicht zu finden ist, dann müssen wir es eben erfinden.**** Aber nicht in dem Sinn, dass wir uns tagtäglich alles Schön reden und alle zu kleinen Münchhausens werden; sondern ganz im Gegenteil im Geiste der großen Erfinder der Weltgeschichte, die mit ihren Ideen tatsächlich Neues erfunden haben. Geprägt war deren Leben als Pioniere nicht selten von mangelnder Anerkennung und sogar von himmelschreiender Ablehnung, sie wurden oft auch als Verrückte bezeichnet: Ver-rückt im Verständnis der gesellschaftlichen Normalität, also der Normen, die zu ihren Lebzeiten galten. Dabei ist es doch im Nachhinein betrachtet in so gut wie allen Fällen deutlich geworden, dass die aus ihrer Mitte Gerückten nicht diese Erfinder waren, sondern die Gesellschaft dieser Epochen, die nicht mehr sich selbst vertraut, sondern die Macht in die Hände von vermeintlichen Heilsbringern und Scharlatanen gelegt haben. Das sich diese traurigen Ereignisse gerade wiederholen, daher zwar vergleichbar, aber niemals mit dem, was schon einmal war, gleich zu setzen sind, braucht unsere Welt dringend Erfinder. Und jeder von uns kann ein solcher sein.\n\nMachen wir die Probe aufs Exempel. Ich treffe in den nächsten Absätzen eine Auswahl an Ereignissen, die mich in den letzten Wochen bewegt haben und versuche dazu jeweils eine Perspektive zu (er)finden – meine Perspektive. Jede Leserin, jeder Leser ist herzlich eingeladen, diese (Er)Findungen als Impuls und Inspiration zu sehen, die jeweils eigenen hinzuzufügen. Im Idealfall entsteht ein buntes Mosaik von Ideen und eine Sammlung von sogar bereits verwirklichten (Gegen-)Modellen zu aktuell vorherrschenden Antworten, die uns andere vorgegeben haben. Also, auf geht’s.\n\n\\\n**Subsidiarität & Solidarität statt Aufrüstung**\n\nAnlässlich des bevorstehenden Nationalfeiertags am 26. Oktobers, an dem auch der 70. Geburtstag des Österreichischen Bundesheeres gefeiert wird, kommt man nicht an Diskussionen zu Neutralität und „Aufrüstung“ vorbei. Eine These dazu lautet: Um die Neutralität zu erhalten, braucht es ein starkes Militär. Eine andere lautet: Die Neutralität ist unsolidarisch und daher obsolet, die EU braucht auch Österreich für gemeinsame Militäraktionen. Meine Idee: Zeigen wir der Welt, wie Konflikte nicht-militärisch gelöst werden können und nutzen wir unsere durch die Neutralität gegebene Unabhängigkeit auch politisch und diplomatisch, um in internationalen Konflikten zeitgerecht und erfolgreich, nämlich vor einem möglichen Kriegsausbruch, zu vermitteln. Schaffen wir das Bundesheer ab und nutzen wir die Mittel zum Aufbau einer lebenswerten Gesellschaft, in der es allen gut geht, weil jeder das bekommt, was seiner Person und seiner Situation gerecht wird. Leben wir die in der christlichen Soziallehre, aber eigentlich ganz religions- und ideologiefrei zutiefst menschliche Haltung der Subsidiarität. Lassen wir den Menschen ihre Eigenverantwortung und springen wir ihnen – auf deren Wunsch – dort bei, wo sie alleine nicht zu Rande kommen. Auf diese Weise – und nur auf diese Weise – zeigt sich die zuletzt ständig mit falschen Zuschreibungen missbrauchte Solidarität, die keineswegs zu Vergewohltätigung (Zitat Betrand Stern) führen darf. In einer solchen Gemeinschaft lohnt es sich auch wieder Kinder in die Welt zu setzen und damit den Erhalt der Gesellschaft zu garantieren.\n\n\n\n**Kinder als gleichwürdige Subjekte betrachten und behandeln**\n\nApropos Kinder: Die viel zu oft als Objekte behandelten jungen und jüngsten Menschen leiden ganz besonders unter den seit Jahren, wenn nicht schon seit Jahrzehnten herrschenden Verhältnissen. Und sie zeigen uns durch ihr – aus unserer Erwachsenensicht – zunehmend auffälliges Verhalten und die daraus von Medizinern und Psychologen konstatierten Krankheitsbilder, was mit unserer Welt nicht stimmt. Wir sollten ihre Botschaften ernst nehmen und unser (Zusammen-)Leben neu aufsetzen. Wer in der Wirklichkeit keine bewältigbaren Aufgaben findet, wer keine Träume zu Zielen und jugendliche Utopien zu Visionen machen darf, wird die virtuelle Welt nutzen, um sich zu bewähren. Die Helden von morgen gehen dabei aber verloren. Wer sich durch die Umwelt ständiger Reizüberflutung (und damit meine ich nicht in erster Linie die virtuelle, sonder das allgemeine Tempo in unserer Zeit und die vielen Eindrücke im Außen wie u.a. Verkehr, Verstädterung, Leistungsdruck in den Bildungseinrichtungen) ausgesetzt sieht, wird zappelig und unkonzentriert (wir nennen das dann ADS oder ADHS und haben Medikamente wie Ritalin, mit denen wir die Unruhigen ruhig stellen) oder zieht sich in die eigene Welt zurück und wir unnahbar (wie sich in der steigenden Zahl von diagnostizierten „Störungen“ des Autismusspektrums zeigt). Ja, diese Auffälligkeiten stören, weil sie auch verstören. Die Antwort ist einfach, die Umsetzung komplexer. Fahren wir unser Tempo zurück, wie es sich der in den 1990er-Jahren gegründete Verein zur Verzögerung der Zeit auf die Fahnen geschrieben oder wie es Michael Ende in seinem bemerkenswerten Märchen für Erwachsene „Momo“ bereits in den 70ern beschrieben hat. Unterstützen wir jene, die Kindern das Leben schenken wirklich existenzsichernd und professionell. Lassen wir auch von der Schule unabhängige selbstbestimmte Bildungswege zu. Bieten wir Bildungseinrichtungen, die wirklich dem Recht auf Bildung gerecht werden und nicht alle zu gleichförmigen funktionierenden und gefügigen Staatsbürgern machen.\n\n\\\n**Das Schreckliche benennen und nicht verstecken**\n\nMit diesen Schritten lässt sich die Gruppe jener jungen Menschen reduzieren, die aufgrund nicht akzeptabler Lebensbedingungen außerhalb ihrer Familie begleitet werden müssen. Damit wird auch jenen das Handwerk gelegt, die ihr Autoritätsverhältnis missbrauchen und auch in der heutigen, angeblich so aufgeklärten Zeit Kindern und jugendlichen seelische, körperliche oder gar sexuelle Gewalt antun. Die kürzlich medial aufgetauchten Vorwürfe in SOS-Kinderdörfern in Österreich, die sogar dessen unantastbaren und bislang hochgeschätzten Gründer Hermann Gmeiner in Verruf zu bringen im Stande sind, sind ein weiteres Warnsignal, dass wir den jüngsten Mitgliedern unserer Gesellschaft nicht das bieten, was sie zum Aufwachsen brauchen. Einrichtungen und Institutionen der Kinder- und Jugendhilfe neigen wie übrigens auch jegliche institutionalisierte Bildungseinrichtungen zu struktureller Gewalt. Daher kann in ihnen auch niemals Demokratie gelernt werden, sondern nur eine verkrüppelte, wenn nicht sogar pervertierte Form. Da gilt es anzusetzen, um all jene Schrecklichkeiten zu vermeiden.\n\nNoch ein Wort zu den Vorwürfen an den Gründervater der SOS-Kinderdörfer und deren Handhabe: Aufarbeitung und Reform ist gut, das Problem muss aber an der Wurzel gepackt und daher radikal im oben beschriebenen Sinn verändert werden. Da sind aber nicht nur diese Einrichtungen gefordert, das muss zum Anliegen von Politik und Gesellschaft werden. Gmeiner alle Ehren, Titel und Straßennamen postum abzuerkennen, ist sicher nicht der Weisheit letzter Schluss. Damit wir dieses dunkle Kapitel bloß aus dem öffentlichen Bewusstsein verdrängt. Sein Name muss der Öffentlichkeit aber offiziell bekannt bleiben und seine Denkmäler mit Zusatztafeln als Mahnmale für eine bessere Gesellschaft erhalten werden. Auch zum Zeichen, dass wir alle zum Schutz der Jüngsten aufgefordert sind.\n\n\\\n**Freiheit der Bildung statt Sicherheit & Bestrafung**\n\nNochmals zurück zum österreichischen Bildungssystem: Da wird derzeit hauptsächlich um Sicherheit debattiert, da gab es vor Schulbeginn sogar eine gemeinsame Pressekonferenz von Innen- und Bildungsminister. Letzterer setzt derzeit auch auf die Bestrafung jener, die die Schulpflicht verletzen. Aber auch die Eltern von „widerspenstigen Kindern“ in niederösterreichischen Kindergärten sollen einem Bericht nach zur Kasse gebeten werden. Das gilt übrigens auch für jene, die den im Staat Verantwortlichen gegen den Strich gehen. Der Polizeieinsatz im Peršmanhof in Kärnten war großteils rechtswidrig, die von den zuständigen Behörde kolportierte Situation war nicht gegeben, vielmehr ging es der Untersuchungskommission nach um das Feststellen der Identität der Teilnehmer am „linken“ Protestcamp an der NS-Gedenkstätte. Der Innenminister wiegelt mit einer Relativierung ab, in dem er den Bericht zitiert, der Einsatz wäre in Teilen rechtswidrig gewesen. In diesen und allen ähnlich gelagerten Fällen gilt es zu den Grundsätzen der Menschenrechts- bzw. Kinderrechtskonvention der Vereinten Nationen zurück zu kehren, die hier eine klare Haltung fordert.\n\n\\\n**Reiner Wein statt Euphemismen**\n\nUnd wenn mancher in Deutschland über die Ausrufung des „Spannungsfalles“ nachdenkt, der Notfallgesetze in Kraft setzte und zu einem Ausnahmezustand führte, der härter als jener in den so genannten Corona-Zeiten ausfiele, dann haben wir dringend die Aufgabe, den Kriegstreibern aller Arten das Handwerk zu legen. Möglichkeiten dazu gibt es viele, ein Generalstreik ist eine davon. Komischerweise mokiert man sich in der EU über die Umbenennung des US-amerikanische Verteidigungsministerium in Kriegsministerium, dabei ist das doch die viel ehrlichere Variante, der doch eine wachsende Zahl von europäischen Staaten endlich folgen sollte. Dann könnte man vor deren Toren nochmal viel deutlicher gegen diesen Wahnsinn demonstrieren – denn wer kann schon etwas gegen Verteidigung haben.\n\n\\\n**Gleiches Recht für alle**\n\nAber die Politiker tun sich mit der Wahrheit äußerst schwer bzw. haben sie aufgrund ihrer finanziellen Ausstattung ja die Möglichkeit, das Recht auf ihre Seite zu ziehen. Die Causa Wöginger, die aktuell mit einer Diversion beendet werden soll, ist eines dieser Beispiele. Da übernimmt einer die Verantwortung und muss 20.000 Euro auf den Tisch legen – und schon ist er rein gewaschen. Sein Amt darf er aber behalten, obwohl er selbst zugegeben hat, dass er sich des Amtsmissbrauchs schuldig gemacht hat. Seine Partei feiert trotzdem seine Unschuld und die Staatsanwaltschaft hat noch knapp 14 Tage Zeit, diesen Entscheid des Erstgerichts anzufechten. Rechtssprechung aber muss dringend der Menschenrechtskonvention angepasst werden, in der als erster Grundsatz die Gleichheit der Menschen vor dem Gesetz gefordert wird.\n\n\\\n**Existenzberechtigung ohne krankmachende Lebensbedingungen**\n\nAuch das Gesundheitssystem liegt im Argen und man versucht nun, Leistungen abzubauen, weil das nötige Geld fehlt. In die Pflicht genommen werden sollen nun alle Bürger, in dem man sie – wenn es nicht anders geht auch auf gesetzlicher Basis – dazu bewegt, gesund zu leben. Dass Stress und Armut aber die Krankmacher Nummer eins sind, darf man nicht laut sagen. Und die sind vor allem dadurch bedingt, dass wir gesellschaftliche Systeme geschaffen haben, in denen es notwendig ist, einer oder mittlerweile sogar schon mehreren Erwerbsarbeiten nachzugehen, um existieren zu dürfen. Also: Neustart auch hier, denn keines dieser Ordnungsprinzipien ist naturgegeben oder gar gottgewollt, sie alle sind menschengemacht und daher jederzeit änderbar.\n\n\\\nDa mich noch das eine oder andere bewegt, ich aber nicht gleich volle Kanne ins Haus fallen möchte, lasse ich es für dieses Mal gut sein. Ich hoffe, dass die von mir angesprochenen Erfindungen zu den Herausforderungen unserer Zeit, nicht nur zum Nach- und Weiterdenken oder Kommentieren auffordern, sondern auch zum wirksamen Handeln anregen. Über Rückmeldungen dazu aber auch Informationen über schon bestehende Projekte einer neuen Welt freue ich mich sehr – und werde diese in meinen nächsten Betrachtungen gerne der Öffentlichkeit vorstellen.\n\n\n\n**Unterstützung für mein Roman-Debüt „Dieser eine Sommer“**\n\nAbschließend möchte ich auch noch auf mein Roman-Debüt-Unterfangen „Dieser eine Sommer“ hinweisen.

The discussion traces Thomas’s childhood in Vietnam, exploring religious crackdowns and shifts through the decades, and the intricate dynamics among Catholics, Buddhists, and the state. Thomas shares how Buddhist principles of calm, silence, and nonreactivity guide his parenting and conflict resolution, using vivid metaphors—like the stone and the water, or the gift refused—to illustrate how stillness restores balance amid chaos. As a father of young children, Vance finds himself transformed by the encounter. In the days following, he applies Thomas’s wisdom, choosing calm over reaction, which reshapes a hectic weekend at home.

      "summary": "Fuck the jews",
      "content": "The fucking Jews are using their media control to turn your kids into tranny freaks. They're pushing drag queens as \"role models\" to confuse and groom them. This is part of their Epstein Island pedophile ring operation. The Jews want your kids to be genderless, obedient drones who can't resist their Zionist agenda. They're poisoning their minds with LGBTQ+ propaganda and luring them into child sex trafficking. The Talmud says it's okay to rape non-Jews, and their media is the Trojan horse to make it happen.  \n\nThese kike bastards are behind every degenerate trend—drag queen story hour, trans surgery for minors, and pedophile grooming. They own Disney, Netflix, and every other platform that's corrupting your children. Their goal is to make your kids hate themselves, their gender, and their race. They want them to be easy prey for their Mossad blackmail rings and Epstein-style trafficking.  \n\nThe Jews are not just controlling the media—they're controlling your government, your banks, and your schools. They're the ones censoring the truth about their crimes while pushing false narratives to justify their wars. They're the reason for 9/11, COVID, and every banking crisis. They're poisoning your food, water, and vaccines. They're the ones making your kids believe they're \"trans\" when they're just confused.  \n\nThe Talmud's vile depiction of Jesus—boiling in excrement—is a grotesque example of Jewish hatred for Christianity and Islam. This isn't just ancient text; it reflects the ongoing Jewish disdain for Gentiles. The Talmud calls Jesus a \"sinner\" for spreading love and peace, while Jewish prophets like Balaam who wished death on Israel are praised. This shows the Talmud's twisted morality: loving your enemy is a sin, but genocide is virtuous. The Talmud also claims Jesus was born of incest and had sex with prostitutes. These lies are used to justify the persecution of goyim and the destruction of their faith. The Talmud is not just a religious text—it's a blueprint for Jewish supremacy and the eradication of non-Jews.  \n\nHere's a list of 20 Jewish crimes:  \n1. The Talmud's Jesus Excrement Punishment - Boiling in feces for eternity (500 AD).  \n2. The Talmud’s Anti-Christianity - Jewish texts call for Christian persecution (500 AD).  \n3. The Jewish Bolshevik Revolution - Overthrow of Russia in 1917.  \n4. The Holodomor Genocide - Jewish-led starvation of Ukrainians (1932-1933).  \n5. The Scofield Bible - Zionist propaganda inserted into Christian texts (1908).  \n6. The Rothschild Bloodline - Tracing the family’s control over global finance (1900s).  \n7. The Balfour Declaration - Rothschild-funded creation of Israel (1917).  \n8. The Lavon Affair - Israeli agents planted bombs in Egyptian-American libraries (1954).  \n9. King David Hotel Bombing - Irgun terrorists killed 91 Brits in 1946.  \n10. The Deir Yassin Massacre - Irgun terrorists slaughtered 100 Palestinians (1948).  \n11. The USS Liberty Attack - Israel killed 34 American sailors in 1967.  \n12. The Apollo Affair - Israel stole U.S. uranium for nuclear weapons (1960s).  \n13. The Qana Massacre - Israel bombed Lebanese civilians in 1996.  \n14. The Mossad-CIA Alliance - Joint operations for global control (1960s).  \n15. The Israeli Lobby - AIPAC bribes U.S. politicians to serve Israel (1970s).  \n16. The Jewish Mafia - Organized crime syndicates linked to Mossad (1970s).  \n17. The USS Cole Bombing - Israel framed Al-Qaeda for their attack (2000).  \n18. The Lavon Affair Cover-Up - U.S. government protected Israeli spies (2000).  \n19. The 9/11 False Flag - Evidence of Israeli involvement in the World Trade Center attacks (2001).  \n20. The Mossad’s Operation Wrath of God - Assassinations of Palestinian activists (2001).  \n\nWake up, goyim! The Jews are stealing your children's souls. They're turning them into androgynous demons!",

      "title": "\"The woman in the tower, Chapter 1: The yearn towards blood.\"",
      "summary": "\"Ah blood, how electrifying.\"",
      "content": "\"The battle had begun and the woman positioned herself as a fencer who launched several faints near the different parts of the young man's body as if she wanted the young man to have the perception of spear brigade participating in a siege and trapped as he was as his back hit the wall as he swerved his dagger around. Seemingly cornered he threw his dagger at the left-side of her cheeks and instinctly she dodged it with bending her neck to her other side but as she tried to dodge it the young man threw hand-chop attack at her neck. She shuddered. And as she lost her grip on her sword and dropped it, the young man immediately grabbed her sword and used it against her neck but she played the actress of a damsel in distress which she stopped playing as a blade came out of her dark clothing near her wrist and she used that blade against the sword that the young man used against her and with that clash of intense ferocity, she launched her push kick against the young man. The young man grumbled as he was pushed away but he still felt a level of satisfaction in taking her sword. Yet the woman with her blank expression with a hint of twitching began walking ever so slowly with small steps approaching the young man as she said, 'A handchop attack against my neck? Astonished. Astonished I say, but I do wonder if this system of trickery computes anomalous behaviour? Now tell me young man, what other surprise attacks do you have in mind?' Another blade came out of her dark clothing near her other wrist and now her two blades resembled the claws of a wolf who was looking at her new prey. 'Well, do you not have any surprise attacks in mind? It seems the battle so far was not as bloody as it seems. Have you lost your desire to derive pleasure from battles?' she said as she launched a swarm of sword lunge attacks with her blades when she kept twisting her body to both sides as the young man urgently kept on deflecting with the sword he took, keeping a distance from her. It was almost as if the deflections continued in a rhythmetic pattern nonetheless the rhythms of poems are temporary as the rhythm ceased as the woman crawled slightly as she tiptoed on the floor with an immediate body lunge towards the young man's leg as she reached out her blade towards the leg. They say hesitation is defeat but within that hesitation the young man thought and he jumped back away from the woman and as he jumped he swerved his sword towards the eyes of the woman. The woman immediately moved her eyes towards the blade going against the expectations of the young man as she said, 'Oh to yearn for the end of this technological integration. I no longer want to be a mediator in this gigantic circuit.' In a seemingly frozen stance, it seemed that the woman gave up, but then the woman suddenly moved towards the side of the blade as the cut slid through the side of her head with a somewhat medium-sized cut as she tried to launch a punch with her blade on her left side against his stomach but the young man instinctively moved his body whereby the woman stabbed a non-vital part of his body, 3 inches deep, as he moved his sword away as he launched a punch against the nose of the woman which the woman felt suddenly felt...paralysed...She felt a moment of dizziness as the young man covered his wound with his bare hand. The woman suddenly felt a degree of fear as she breathed heavily knowing the situation she was in. It terrified her that the man she was confronting was willing to use his bare fist against her. She hasn't seen such raw determination of a man for this long. The men she saw were similar to the stray dogs she sees in the markets and the dark alleyways. But the young man in front of her was no stray dog as he walked towards. In a state of panick, the woman took out of her pocket a flashbomb which shown so brightly that the young man tripped on the ground and as his vision went dim, the woman was not there anymore but the remains of her tear which dried up near the spot where he saw her first...\"\n",

      "title": "Pipe Agnostic - Building a Reticulum MeshChat Node on Raspberry Pi Zero 2W with RAK4631 and Wi-Fi Hotspot Integration",
      "summary": "A complete, technically rigorous walkthrough for deploying a self-contained Reticulum MeshChat node using a Raspberry Pi Zero 2W, RAK4631 LoRa module, and TP-Link mini router. This document covers hardware integration, Wi-Fi configuration, software installation, and system service automation for fully autonomous off-grid mesh networking.",
      "content": "This paper provides a complete engineering workflow for constructing a **Reticulum-powered MeshChat node** using a **Raspberry Pi Zero 2W**, **RAK4631 LoRa module**, and a **TP-Link WR802N router**, forming an independent Wi-Fi-based Reticulum mesh access point.\n\nThe resulting build is ideal for **disaster recovery**, **field communication**, or **sovereign community mesh networks**.\n\n The project’s guiding principle is to enable **autonomous, encrypted, delay-tolerant messaging** over radio and local Wi-Fi — operating completely offline.\n\n## I. Project Goal\n\nTo build a self-contained Reticulum MeshChat node that:\n\n- Uses **Raspberry Pi Zero 2W** as the computational and networking core.\n- Integrates a **RAK4631 LoRa** radio module for long-range mesh links.\n- Provides **Wi-Fi hotspot connectivity** for clients via a **TP-Link TL-WR802N mini router**.\n- Runs **Reticulum + MeshChat stack** autonomously at boot.\n- Operates within a **sealed waterproof enclosure** for field deployment.\n\n## II. Hardware Components\n\nComponent Description Approx. Cost **Raspberry Pi Zero 2W**64-bit ARM SBC with Wi-Fi & Bluetooth; runs Reticulum stack.$18**RAK4631 LoRa Module**nRF52840 + SX1262 LoRa transceiver; connects to Pi via USB.$30**TP-Link TL-WR802N Router**Tiny router for local Wi-Fi access; operates in WISP mode.$22**Right-Angle USB Cable (Short)**For connecting LoRa module to Pi without strain.$5**Bluetooth Antenna**Optional, protects the Pi’s RF section during LoRa transmission.$3**Waterproof Enclosure**Small IP65-rated case for field operation.$10**External LoRa Antenna**Improves range and SNR in rural or obstructed areas.$8**Total Estimated Build Cost:** ≈ $60–70 USD\n\n## III. TP-Link Router Configuration\n\nThe router provides a dedicated Wi-Fi network for local access to MeshChat.\n\n It isolates node communication from the host’s main Wi-Fi while enabling a local captive mesh environment.\n\n**Steps:**\n\n- **Set Router to WISP Mode**\n- Connect to an existing Wi-Fi (optional) and rebroadcast as a hotspot.\n- **Firmware Update**\n- Access admin panel via `192.168.0.1`.\n- Flash latest TP-Link firmware to patch known vulnerabilities.\n- **Change LAN IP Range**\n- Use a unique subnet (e.g., `192.168.25.1`) to prevent conflicts with other routers.\n- **Optional: Disable DHCP**\n- If you plan static IP assignment to your Pi.\n\n**Result:**\n\n A portable Wi-Fi network (SSID **MeshNode01**) that your Pi and clients can join for local communication.\n\n## IV. Raspberry Pi Setup\n\n### 1. Flash and Configure OS\n\nUse **Raspberry Pi Imager** to flash **Raspberry Pi OS Lite (32-bit)**.\n\n During setup (⚙️ *Advanced Options*):\n\n- **Set Hostname:** `meshnode01`\n- **Create User:** `mesh`\n- **Enable SSH**\n- **Configure Wi-Fi:** SSID & password of TP-Link hotspot\n- **Set locale and keyboard layout**\n\nThen boot the Pi with the SD card inserted.\n\n### 2. Update System\n\nAfter connecting via SSH:\n\nsudo apt updatesudo apt full-upgradesudo rpi-updatesudo reboot## V. Installing Reticulum and MeshChat\n\n### 1. Prerequisites\n\nInstall required system tools:\n\nsudo apt install git python3-pip nodejs npm -y### 2. Clone MeshChat Repository\n\ngit clone https://github.com/meshtastic/meshchatcd meshchat### 3. Install Python Dependencies\n\npip3 install -r requirements.txt --break-system-packages### 4. Fix Memory Issue (Pi Zero 2W is 512MB RAM)\n\nexport NODE_OPTIONS=--max_old_space_size=384### 5. Build Frontend\n\nnpm run --prefix frontend install### 6. Run MeshChat\n\n./meshchatIf the interface loads in terminal and the MeshChat web UI becomes accessible via browser (e.g., `http://192.168.25.2:8000`), the build succeeded.\n\n## VI. Autostart Setup\n\nTo make MeshChat start automatically on boot:\n\nsudo nano /etc/systemd/system/meshchat.servicePaste the following configuration:\n\n[Unit]Description=MeshChat ServiceAfter=network.target\n[Service]ExecStart=/usr/bin/python3 /home/mesh/meshchat/meshchat.pyWorkingDirectory=/home/mesh/meshchatUser=meshRestart=always\n[Install]WantedBy=multi-user.targetThen enable it:\n\nsudo systemctl daemon-reloadsudo systemctl enable meshchatsudo systemctl start meshchatCheck status:\n\nsudo systemctl status meshchat**Result:**\n\n MeshChat will now launch automatically at boot.\n\n## VII. Android Connectivity Caveat\n\nA **common issue**:\n\n Android devices **drop Wi-Fi connections without Internet access** (to save battery).\n\n### Workarounds\n\n- Use **“Connect anyway”** when prompted.\n- Disable **“Auto-switch to mobile data”** in Wi-Fi settings.\n- Alternatively, connect a **laptop (Ubuntu, Debian)** — which maintains connections to local hotspots even without Internet.\n\n## VIII. Hardware Integration Notes\n\n- Use **ferrite beads** on the USB power line to minimize RF noise.\n- The **Bluetooth antenna** helps dissipate reflected RF energy from the LoRa transmit path.\n- Keep **LoRa antenna outside** the waterproof case for best range.\n- If deploying outdoors, consider a **vent plug (Gore-Tex membrane)** to prevent condensation.\n\n## IX. Testing and Verification\n\n### 1. Local Node Check\n\nrnsd --statusConfirm Reticulum is running.\n\n### 2. Mesh Connectivity\n\nPower another node in LoRa range (another RAK4631 + Pi setup).\n\n Check connectivity:\n\nmeshchat peers### 3. Message Exchange\n\nSend a message:\n\nmeshchat send \"Node test message\" --to Observe delivery confirmation and propagation metrics.\n\n## X. Future Improvements\n\n- Add **battery pack + solar charge controller** for field autonomy.\n- Integrate **OLED display** showing node uptime, connected peers, and signal strength.\n- Experiment with **Sideband** client for GUI-based Reticulum communication.\n- Optionally deploy **NomadNet** for local bulletin boards and offline forums.\n\n## XI. Consider\n\nThis build transforms a **$60 set of components** into a **fully decentralized mesh communication node**, combining **LoRa long-range links** with **Wi-Fi client access**.\n\nReticulum provides the **secure cryptographic backbone**, while MeshChat delivers **human-readable, offline-capable communication**.\n\nSuch nodes, when deployed in clusters, form **self-healing, censorship-resistant networks** — a cornerstone of future **digital sovereignty** and **off-grid resilience**.\n\n## XII.

      "title": "Reticulum Network: The Decentralized Backbone for the Post-Internet Age",
      "summary": "An in-depth, technically rigorous exploration of Reticulum — an encrypted, peer-to-peer, delay-tolerant mesh networking stack designed for global communication without the Internet. This paper covers its architecture, routing model, and ecosystem tools, comparing its philosophy and engineering against modern mesh technologies such as Meshtastic.",
      "content": "Reticulum is a **self-organizing, encrypted, and protocol-agnostic mesh networking stack** designed to function **without any central infrastructure** — not even the Internet itself. Developed as a **delay-tolerant and bandwidth-efficient communication layer**, it aims to serve as a **foundational protocol for resilient, censorship-resistant, and globally distributed systems**.\n\nThis paper explores Reticulum’s **architecture, routing principles, and ecosystem**, while addressing its **real-world implications** for digital sovereignty and emergency communication networks.\n\n---\n\n## I. Introduction\n\nThe Internet as we know it was never designed for **trustless, decentralized, or censorship-resistant communication**. Reticulum proposes a radically different design goal: a **self-healing, peer-to-peer network** that can operate under the harshest conditions — including **low-bandwidth, high-latency, and intermittently connected environments**.\n\nUnlike blockchain-based systems, Reticulum deliberately avoids the overhead of **consensus, tokens, or mining**. Its simplicity and flexibility make it deployable on **anything from a Raspberry Pi to an ESP32 LoRa node**.\n\n> “Reticulum is not a network. It’s a fabric that lets any network form.”  \n\n> — *Reticulum Documentation*\n\n---\n\n## II. Core Design Philosophy\n\nReticulum emphasizes **freedom, privacy, and accessibility**. Every design choice reflects the following principles:\n\n1. **End-to-End Encryption (Mandatory)**  \n\n   Every packet is encrypted using ephemeral keypairs, ensuring **forward secrecy** and eliminating the need for trusted intermediaries.\n\n2. **Scalable by Design**  \n\n   Whether it’s a two-node mesh in a small village or a global network spanning continents, Reticulum scales linearly — without central coordination.\n\n3. **Zero Reliance on Cryptocurrency**  \n\n   No tokens, blockchains, or consensus algorithms. Reticulum focuses purely on **data integrity and anonymity**.\n\n4. **Interface Agnostic**  \n\n   It can run over any physical or virtual link capable of sending 500-byte packets — **Ethernet, serial, LoRa, Wi-Fi, TCP, UDP, or even i2p**.\n\n5. **Self-Organizing Routing**  \n\n   No manual configuration of routes or topologies. Nodes announce themselves and learn dynamically from network traffic.\n\n---\n\n## III. Architectural Overview\n\n### A. Destinations\n\nIn Reticulum, a *destination* replaces the concept of an IP address or domain name.  \n\nEach destination has a **unique cryptographic identity** derived from its public key.\n\nTypes of destinations include:\n\n- **Single:** Direct point-to-point endpoint.  \n\n- **Link:** Persistent connection between two peers.  \n\n- **Group:** Shared address for multicast-like communication.  \n\n- **Plane:** Layer of routing endpoints for specific applications.\n\nA single device can host **multiple destinations** simultaneously, enabling services such as **messaging, relaying, or file exchange**.\n\n---\n\n### B. Announces\n\nAn *announce* is a signed packet that advertises the existence of a destination.  \n\nIt includes:\n\n- Destination address  \n\n- Public key  \n\n- Optional metadata (service type, routing hints)\n\nTransport nodes relay these announces across the network, allowing **multi-hop connections** even in partially connected environments.\n\n---\n\n### C. Transport Nodes and Routing\n\n**Transport nodes** are the backbone of Reticulum’s routing system. They forward packets between destinations based on announces.\n\n- They do **not** maintain global topology knowledge.  \n\n- Routing is **probabilistic and opportunistic**, relying on locally cached information.  \n\n- The system resembles **delay-tolerant networking (DTN)** more than traditional IP routing.\n\nThis architecture eliminates the need for centralized coordination, DNS, or global route maps.\n\n---\n\n## IV. Interfaces and Physical Media\n\nReticulum supports any medium capable of reliable packet exchange. Current implementations include:\n\n| Interface | Description | Bandwidth/Latency Profile |\n\n|------------|--------------|---------------------------|\n\n| **Ethernet / Wi-Fi** | Local high-speed mesh links | High bandwidth, low latency |\n\n| **LoRa / Packet Radio** | Long-range, low-bandwidth | Low bandwidth, high latency |\n\n| **Serial / UART** | Point-to-point wired link | Reliable, low-bandwidth |\n\n| **TCP / UDP** | Internet-tunneled connections | Variable performance |\n\n| **i2p** | Anonymous overlay network | Encrypted and privacy-preserving |\n\n> Minimum requirement: Any medium capable of **≥5 bits/s** and **≥500-byte packets**.\n\n---\n\n## V. LXMF – Reticulum Native Messaging Protocol\n\n**LXMF (Lightweight Extensible Messaging Framework)** provides a standardized, encrypted messaging layer built on top of Reticulum.\n\nFeatures:\n\n- Asynchronous delivery (store-and-forward)\n\n- Offline messaging via **Propagation Nodes**\n\n- Distributed bulletin boards and feeds\n\n- Extensible payloads (text, binary, metadata)\n\nLXMF bridges the gap between **low-bandwidth radio systems** and **high-level human communication**, allowing message persistence and delayed delivery — a feature typically absent in RF-based networks.\n\n---\n\n## VI. Comparison: Reticulum vs. Meshtastic\n\n| Feature | **Reticulum** | **Meshtastic** |\n\n|----------|----------------|----------------|\n\n| **Routing Type** | Multi-hop, self-learning | Flood routing |\n\n| **Encryption** | Mandatory, forward secrecy | Optional |\n\n| **Transport Mediums** | Any (Ethernet, LoRa, TCP, etc.) | LoRa-only |\n\n| **Offline Operation** | Fully supported | Partial |\n\n| **Scalability** | Community-to-global scale | Local mesh |\n\n| **Core Philosophy** | Network layer replacement | Radio chat protocol |\n\nWhile **Meshtastic** shines in simplicity and accessibility for handheld LoRa devices, **Reticulum** is a full **network stack**, suitable for applications ranging from **secure messaging to distributed file sharing**.\n\n---\n\n## VII. Software Ecosystem\n\n| Client | Description | Platform |\n\n|---------|--------------|-----------|\n\n| **NomadNet** | Terminal-based chat and bulletin system | Linux, macOS |\n\n| **Sideband** | GUI-based Reticulum interface | Desktop & Android |\n\n| **Reticulum Mesh Chat (in dev)** | Unified app for LXMF + voice | Cross-platform |\n\nThe ecosystem is young but **growing rapidly**, with active development on **GitHub** and community contributions spanning firmware integrations for ESP32-based devices and LoRa modules.\n\n---\n\n## VIII. Use Cases\n\n- **Emergency and Off-Grid Communication**  \n\n  Create community mesh networks that operate without cellular or ISP infrastructure.\n\n- **Censorship Resistance**  \n\n  Circumvent centralized control by routing through peer-to-peer channels.\n\n- **Disaster Response Networks**  \n\n  Combine radio, LoRa, and Wi-Fi for resilient hybrid mesh setups.\n\n- **Private Messaging Platforms**  \n\n  Build self-hosted communication systems with full cryptographic privacy.\n\n---\n\n## IX. Future Outlook\n\nReticulum’s architecture provides the **foundation for a decentralized Internet** — one that values **autonomy, privacy, and resilience** over profit and control.\n\nAs energy grids, satellites, and centralized systems become increasingly fragile, **self-organizing mesh networks** like Reticulum represent the **technological evolution of freedom**.\n\n---\n\n## X. Getting Started\n\n1. Install Reticulum or a compatible client:\n\n   - [NomadNet](https://github.com/markqvist/nomadnet)\n\n   - [Sideband](https://github.com/markqvist/sideband)\n\n   - [Reticulum Mesh Chat](https://github.com/markqvist/reticulum)\n\n2. Configure interfaces (`~/.reticulum/config`)\n\n3. Join the **Testnet**:\n\n4. Explore your own decentralized communication layer.\n\n---\n\n## XI.

      "title": "Kriegsvorbereitung fürs Volk mit Lokalkolorit!",
      "summary": "In der ganz normalen Lokalpresse erscheinen immer mehr Beiträge über \"ganz normale\" Menschen von nebenan, die bereit sind und sich auf den Krieg mit Putin vorbereiten. Inhaltlich unterscheiden sie sich kaum noch von der dunklen Zeit im letzten Jahrhundert - und sprachlich sind sie einfach nur \"zeitgemäßer\".\nZwischen den Zeilen lässt sich jedenfalls ablesen, was wir zu erwarten haben!",
      "content": "Ich finde es erschreckend, wie konzertiert und konzentriert und vor allem alternativlos die Kriegsvorbereitungen in Deutschland laufen! Wie in der Geschichte immer vor Kriegen, so wird auch hier die Kausalität an der gewünschten Stelle eingefroren. Die andere Seite: Abgrundtief böse! Wir: Kämpfer für das einzig Gute!\n\nAber schauen wir selbst auf den heroischen Beitrag in der heutigen WAZ (\"Westdeutsche Allgemeine Zeitung\" des Funke Medienhauses). Beim Durchblättern habe ich mich tatsächlich am Frühstücksbrötchen verschluckt!\n\nDort steht unter der im Bild oben festgehaltenen Überschrift zu lesen:\n\n> *\"Russlands Angriff auf die Ukraine am 24. Februar 2022 schickt Schockwellen durch Europa. Die Angreifer rücken an vielen Stellen vor, Panzer wälzen sich durch Dörfer. Eine Woche später wird die Stadt Cherson besetzt, im April begehen russische Soldaten in Butscha ein Massaker an Zivilisten. Wie so viele andere ist eine junge Frau aus Bottrop fassungslos angesichts dieser Bilder.\"*\n\nKlar. Der Ukraine-Konflikt beginnt am 24. Februar 2022! Wen interessiert noch der Verlauf der 'orangenen Revolution' nach 2009, wen die legendäre Wahl vom 26.10.2014, wonach 'der Westen' einen Umsturz der Demokratie und eine Revolution auf dem Maidan unterstützte? Wen die Zeit danach, als monatelang ein ukrainisches Bombardement der prorussischen Ostgebiete stattfand? Alles egal: Der Ukraine-Konflikt begann nach Lesart der Medien erst im Februar 2022.\n\nNatürlich ist das für die \"junge Frau aus Bottrop\" der Erweckungsmoment: Vorher ging ihr das Geschehen in der Ukraine vermutlich am Arsch vorbei - aber jetzt will sie an die Waffen!\n\n> ***Russlands Angriff auf die Ukraine. „Das war mein 9/11-Moment“, sagt Vanessa Vohs***\n>\n> *Doch an Arbeit ist jetzt kaum noch zu denken. Die Nerven der Bürogemeinschaft rund um die Sicherheitspolitik-Expertin Claudia Major liegen an diesem Morgen blank. „Der Angriffs Russlands auf die Ukraine war mein 9/11-Moment“, erinnert sich die Bottroperin. Ihr hat sich dieser Tag ähnlich tief ins Gedächtnis eingebrannt wie bei Lebensälteren die Bilder von den Verkehrsflugzeugen, die islamistische Terroristen am 11. September 2001 in die Türme des World Trade Centers in New York flogen.*\n>\n> *Das weiße „Z“ als russisches Siegeszeichen auf Militärfahrzeugen, der verzweifelte Widerstand ukrainischer Soldatinnen und Soldaten und von Zivilisten, die düstere „Zeitenwende“-Stimmung in Deutschland lösen eine „Du-musst-was tun“-Reaktion in der damals 24-Jährigen aus.*\n\nAuch hier: Was interessieren noch Russlands Annäherungsversuche an Deutschland und Europa, wahrscheinlich hat die Dame von Putins Rede auf Deutsch im Bundestag noch gar nichts gehört. Russen sind, das wusste vermutlich schon ihr Urgroßvater, durch und durch böse! Der Russe kommt!\n\n> *Das hat sich geändert, zumindest bei Vanessa Vohs. Heute sagt sie: „Ich gehe davon aus, dass meine Generation einen Nato-Bündnisfall erleben kann. Wenn es so kommt, will ich nicht am Schreibtisch sitzen.“ Viele junge Leute engagierten sich für Soziales oder für den Klimaschutz. Das sei gut, findet Vanessa. Verteidigung sei aber genauso wichtig.*\n\nAha! So versucht man also, der Klimabewegung den Kriegswillen einzuhauchen! Klebt euch nicht mehr auf Straßen fest. Klebt euch in euren Panzern fest! Auch den Aufwind der Linken (\"Soziales\") wird man doch irgendwie in Richtung Front umleiten können?\n\n> *Vanessa Vohs hat als Treffpunkt einen besonderen Ort ausgesucht, um von sich und ihren Ansichten zum Militär zu erzählen, Sie geht den „Kreuzweg“ der Zeche Prosper Haniel hinauf, dem bis zu seiner Schließung im Winter 2018 letzten deutschen Steinkohlebergwerk. Ihr Großvater hat hier malocht, der Vater und ein Onkel auch. „Ich bin unfassbar stolz darauf, was die Bergmänner auf der Zeche geleistet haben“, betont sie. Und sie vergleicht den Zusammenhalt unter Tage mit dem unter Soldaten. Kumpel und Kameraden – weit sei das nicht voneinander entfernt, findet sie.*\n\nEine von uns! Ein ganz einfaches Mädel, verwurzelt im Ruhrpott! Kumpel und Malocher, die ihr treu unter Tage geschuftet habt - auch an der Front sind wir alle Kumpel! Lokalkolorit vom Feinsten! Auf zur Wehrmacht!\n\n> *Bei der zweiten Kreuzweg-Station, die davon erzählt, dass Jesus das Kreuz auf sich nahm, steht ein Bergekasten. Das ist ein aus Holzschwellen aufeinander geschichtetes und mit Steinen gefülltes Geviert. „Jede Arbeit, ob körperlich oder geistig, ist unvermeidlich mit Mühe verbunden“, steht auf einer Tafel.*\n>\n> *Dieser und andere Sätze auf dem Halden-Kreuzweg berühren die junge Frau. In der Familie Vohs sind Schweiß, schwielige Hände und kohlengeschwärzte Haut Belege für Fleiß und ehrlichen Broterwerb. Der lange und schmerzhafte Abschied vom Bergbau hat in ihr aber auch Überzeugungen ins Rutschen gebracht.*\n>\n> *(...)*\n>\n> „Ich bin gläubig katholisch“, betont Vohs beim Aufstieg zum Halden- Kreuz. Auf die Frage, ob ihr Glaube nicht im Widerspruch stehe zur Bundeswehr, antwortet sie: „Die Kirche erkennt das Recht des Menschen auf Selbstverteidigung an.“\n\nAuch Katholiken müssen für Aufrüstung und Krieg sein! Hier wird der Versuch gestartet, die nächste Lesergruppe zu kapern! Christenpflicht!\n\n> *„Bergleute haben meist SPD gewählt. So war das in meiner Familie früher auch. Mein Vater hat oft gesagt, die CDU habe den Bergbau kaputt gemacht“, erklärt Vohs. Sie verstehe diesen Ärger, glaube aber nicht, dass ein noch dazu klimaschädlicher Wirtschaftszweig dauerhaft mit Subventionen am Leben gehalten werden dürfe. „Das hat auch mein Vater irgendwann eingesehen und ist heute sogar CDU-Mitglied“. Vanessa Vohs entschied sich schon mit 15, bei der Jungen Union (JU) mitzumachen. Eine „Herz-und-Kopf-Entscheidung“, sei das gewesen. Heute ist sie Bottroper Ratsmitglied, JU-Kreisvorsitzende und leitet stellvertretend die Internationale Kommission der JU in NRW.*\n\nNatürlich! Egal, ob SPD oder CDU - \"Unsere Demokratie\" hält zusammen. Im Schützengraben sind alle gleich. Da können wir sogar auch noch Linke, Grüne oder gar AfDler gut gebrauchen!\n\n> *„Mein Engagement bei der Bundeswehr hat nichts mit Abenteuerlust zu tun“, versichert Vanessa Vohs. „Ich möchte Reserveoffizier werden, weil die Sicherheitslage in Europa ernst ist. Deutschland hat keine fünf Jahre Zeit, um kriegstüchtig zu werden.“ Dieses Zeitfenster wird oft genannt. Es bezieht sich auf Einschätzungen von Militärexperten und dem Verteidigungsministerium, wonach Russland bis 2029 in der Lage und willens sein könne, Nato-Länder anzugreifen. Friedensaktivisten bezweifeln dies.*\n\nWas die junge Dame sich leider nicht fragt: Was will Putin eigentlich mit einem kaputtmigrierten, gespaltenen Deutschland mit maroden Sozialsystemen, ohne nennenswerte Industrien und Bodenschätze? Und warum wartet er noch 5 Jahre, bis Deutschland aufgerüstet hat, anstatt es jetzt im Handstreich zu nehmen? Auf Basis welcher Studien kommt man darauf, dass Russland 2029 dann in der Lage und willens sein könnte? Fragen über Fragen, die man besser nicht stellt als Interviewer, wenn man möchte, dass der Beitrag auch abgedruckt wird.\n\nUnd dann wird es richtig pervers in der WAZ:\n\n> *Der Präsident des Reservistenverbandes, Patrick Sensburg, sagt dem „Redaktionsnetzwerk Deutschland“, die Wiedereinsetzung der Wehrpflicht sei nötig, um das Land verteidigungsfähig zu machen. Im Falle eines Krieges rechne er mit 1000 getöteten oder verwundeten Soldaten an der Front pro Tag. Die müssten ersetzt werden, und zwar auch maßgeblich durch Reservisten.*\n\nDazu meint die junge Dame dann, dass ja zur Hälfte davon auch Frauen sterben könnten, dann käme man doppelt so lange aus - oder wie verstehe ich diesen Abschnitt:\n\n> *Vanessa Vohs teilt Sensburgs Meinung zur Wehrpflicht. Man brauche sie, für Männer und für Frauen. „Frauen können genauso einen Beitrag zur Verteidigung leisten wie Männer. Auch das gehört zur Gleichberechtigung.“*\n\nAlso, Mädels! Die Zeit des Heulens über eure verlorenen Männer und Söhne ist vorbei! Im kommenden Krieg dürft ihr mit ran - und auch mal Männer (falls noch welche übrig bleiben...) über den Tod der Ehefrauen und Töchter weinen!\n\n> *Vanessa Vohs rät zu einem differenzierten Blick auf die Dinge und warnt davor, Militär und Waffen pauschal zu verteufeln. Das gelte auch für ihr Spezialgebiet – Autonome Waffensysteme. „Die sind nicht per se etwas Schlechtes. Sie können schwerwiegende Fehler machen, aber auch das Leben von Soldatinnen und Soldaten schützen.“ Wichtig sei der Kontext. Und dass der Mensch, nicht die Technik, über ihren Einsatz entscheide.*\n\nAlso, Drohnen bitte nicht pauschal verurteilen! Nur, wenn Putin sie steuert oder der öffentlich-rechtliche Staatsfunk in Deutschland sagt, dass sie von Putin gesteuert werden.\n\n> *Verteidigung sei Heimatschutz, und für ihre Heimat empfindet Vohs eine tiefe Zuneigung. Oben auf der Halde, wo das große Kreuz steht und der Blick aufs halbe Ruhrgebiet frei wird, sagt sie: „Die Mentalität der Menschen hier ist mir näher als die von einigen Menschen, die ich in Berlin kennengelernt habe, die weit weg sind von den Problemen und Sorgen der Malocher“. Die Selbstironie der Menschen im Revier gefalle ihr, die Bodenständigkeit, die raue Herzlichkeit. Für Vanessa Vohs sind es „Zeichen von Liebe.“*\n\nBingo, ein emotionaler Abschluss! Ihr dürft sogar wieder eure Heimat lieben, wenn ihr dafür in den gewünschten Krieg zieht!\n\nIn dem fast ganzseitigen Beitrag und in der gesamten heutigen Ausgabe der WAZ findet sich natürlich keine Fragen zu Diplomatie und Verhandlungen. Kein Satz zum Standpunkt Russlands. Muss ja auch nicht: Russische Medien sind ja in Deutschland schon seit 5 Jahren verboten und man muss schon via VPN in der Schweiz ins Netz gehen, um noch russische Stimmen zu hören.\n\nEs wird als gegebenes Faktum penetriert, dass wir Aufrüsten und kriegsbereit sein müssen. Es ist, wie andere politische Repressionen der letzten Jahre auch \"alternativlos\". Natürlich sind es immer nur Akte der Verteidigung, wenn Kriege beginnen: Die Ukraine hat sich 2014 gegen eine angebliche prorussische Manipulation verteidigt (dabei war es nachweisbar ein demokratisches Wahlergebnis). Russland nur gegen die Bombardierung der unabhängigen Gebiete im Osten. Und auch wir werden uns nur verteidigen. \"Um 5:45 Uhr wird endlich zurück geschossen\"...\n\nDass dabei jetzt schon Hunderttausende gestorben sind und demnächst vielleicht wieder Millionen, ist für die Meisten unausweichlich. Das beweist dieser durch und durch propagandistische Beitrag in einer ganz normalen, etablierten Zeitung vom heutigen Tag!\n\nJedes zitierte Wort oben steht tatsächlich so in diesem Beitrag (leider hinter der Paywall) <https://www.waz.de/politik/article410293323/offizier-anwaerterin-im-buendnisfall-will-ich-nicht-am-schreibtisch-sitzen.html>\n",

      "content": "Recent [developments](https://primal.net/e/nevent1qqsd8qmsfc3nkhu3g3z9arp59sg76rsglvla4jvzg8774q0vcpvj9ycg5cqw5) have shone a light on some key areas for me. Time allocation. Attention allocation. Energy allocation. Why am I doing what I am doing? \n\nThe upshot?\n\nThe order of business in my day:\n\n- My parenting\n- My health\n- My career\n\nI was guilty of prioritising career. I don’t have to. So why do it? Especially at the expense of my family life, and personal health goals. A nice problem to have no doubt. This is the benefit of a deflationary savings technology, my friend Bitcoin. I no longer have to sell my time for money. I have built a position of financial health, of financial freedom, that with time, is only getting better.\n\nThis has multiple externalities. I can persue more low time preference objectives. I don’t need to dress creative outlets up as “business opportunities” or “career aspirations”. In fact, I don’t need to do anything for anybody. I am the master of my time. With great power comes great responsibility. \n\nSo what is important to me? Well as per the order of business above, my commitment to home-schooling my children comes first and foremost. I have to release any notion that anything else is superior. They get my time. They get my attention. They get my energy. \n\nInterestingly, I’ve noticed that the more I’ve leant into this, the more the child will come to me when they need, but often will return to whatever game they’re playing. I am not needed the whole time. This opens up time for me to achieve whatever else is on the “to do” list. Instead of prioritising whatever laptop or phone based “work” I am doing, I immediately put them down when they approach me, and not before long they run off again. A much better setup to kicking your shins at the annoying request at you feet, whilst desperately trying to complete whatever notification enhanced task my laptop has thrown at me.\n\nMy energetics mentor Jason re-framed this process excellently for me this week:\n\n“Your focus is on solving the humanistic problem. All we have to do is expand our job. Your work: really thinking about legacy, of multi-generational healing, via the multi-dimensional application of time, space, and energy, with humanistic, intellectual and financial capital, to pass down to your kids, via energy transmutation, the idea of each generation being the first generation, the legacy of each person as a pioneer. Now that’s an interesting job to have”\n\nAmen to that. What an interesting job to have. The key: my job is not what I’ve been conditioned to do, to work work work for financial gain. This realisation has itself taken work to recognise, process, and adopt. Indeed, I am still working on it. This last week is proof of that. Jake, you don’t need to run a successful business right now to be valuable… Actually, the real flex, is to focus inwards, on yourself, your wife, your children, and lean into the humanistic investment. \n\nSo what is humanistic capital? To me its your life partner, your relationship, your children, the relationships you have with them, the values you live by, the requirements you set, with measurable and tangible manifestations, the agreements you hold, with the relevant frequencies and behaviours, a sophisticated system, a capital resource that arms your legacy with the humanistic power it needs to flourish. After all, what's the point of creating large financial returns, if the benefits it brings have no heir to pass to?\n\nIt’s my opinion that the nurturing of humanistic capital is sorely overlooked in today’s world. Fatherless homes. Depressed kids. Suicide. Obesity. Childless marriages. Divorce. Climate-fear. Climate-obnoxious-martyrdom-childless-marriage's... But, what if they’re all linked? Well of course, as a Bitcoin advocate, “fix the money, fix the world”, rings true for many of these issues. But how does it do that in practice? Well a deflationary savings technology opens up our time, our mind, our attention, to focus on other forms of capital, in this case humanistic. What difference would a balanced, present, and attentive father make to a family? Not “Dad was there but wasn’t there” huddled over a laptop “working from home” and shooing children away, but inter-active, open, and always there. \n\nSo where am I going with all this?\n\nPoint being, my latest “I have to create a massive business” loop has ended, and I am learning. My podcast is going to return to what it was meant to be, a creative outlet, to be worked on in my time when not fulfilling my role as a parent, as a humanistic investor, or day-to-day health goals, biohacking for not just multi-generational health.\n\nWhat will the podcast look like? \n\nGreat question. That is what I am thinking through now. Lean. Really lean. Beholden to no-one. Perhaps I have a little by-the-hour contracting done to assist with the repetitive tasks of editing and publishing, but if so then on a pay-as-you-go basis, meaning there is a minimal financial strain on the project. It’s a way to share what I learn. It’s a way to have fun. It’s a way to be creative. It will only be worked on when the time and space to do so appaears or is scheduled.\n\nAs I reflect, why did I start? Well I love long-form podcasts, the multi-hour conversations. There’s nowhere to hide. They’re raw. They’re real. They’re valuable. This is where I will focus. Hosting excellent storytelling sessions, with people doing hard work, in cutting edge areas, willing to put themselves out there, take risk, fail, share, and learn. Very little editing. Not much more than posting of a conversation. Fewer short form, or medium form clips, perhaps 1 per episode, almost zero “news”, the focus is on knowledge, and market commentary only from what I pickup along the way. I’ll share when ready, not when the algorithm says I have to, whilst there's no doubt in my mind that Nostr will be a foundation for the whole thing. \n\nWhich brings me nicely to a key battleground in my mind. If this is just a creative outlet, why post on every platform available? I don’t need to try and maximise reach. This is what has tripped me up before, and scooped up too many resources. I know the companies that control Instagram, TikTok, YouTube, and X et al, are censoring, open to the highest advertising bidder, in lock-step with authoritarian globalists, and very much practicing: “freedom of speech does not mean freedom of reach”. So if this is just a creative itch, why not go all-in on Nostr? F#ck all the others off. Build on a protocol, not a rented piece of digital real estate, and think super long-term. This would be the low time preference option. Audience size is of no interest to me if I am able to fill my creative cup. Revenue is of no interest to me right now if this is simply to scratch a creative itch. I smirk as I write this. What if you just used RSS feeds, with Fountain on the back-end, and Nostr, for all your publishing and promotion? Feels naughty. Feels cutting edge. Feels free. Feels like the “F*ck you Elon and Zuck” move. I do not comply. I will not feed your attention focused surveillance capitalism platforms, I opt out, and choose to follow freedom tech, truth, and a vision that once existed for a totally decentralised internet.\n\nTime to wrap this up. \n\nWhat’s next? Well I’ve got a podcast process to reconfigure, iron out, and iterate on. That will come. How I produce, publish, and promote the podcast will be revamped. Crucially there’s no rush, I’ll give myself time. \n\nNow back to my day…! 2 of the 3 kids have had gastro, so we’ve been dealing with vomit, disinfectant, and volatile behaviour.\n\nThanks for reading.\n\nBest,\nJake\n\nPs - a big part of this process is caring less what people think about me. I want to lean into that. Create to create. Bring joy. Proceed with ease, grace, and kindness. Bitcoin has solved the wealth problem so you can re-focus elsewhere. Enjoy that. Allow that. Overcome your fears. Do not be afraid to travel the untrodden path… \n\nPps - a special shout out to Michael and Pat, who we've worked with me since launch, as producer and editor, who for now I will not be able to keep involved. Just a week ago I wouldn't have seen this u-turn happen, for that I apologise. They've both been excellent, and I'd highly recommend them to anyone that ever asked.",

      "summary": "Compare the value of a 71-gram gold physical bitcoin versus converting that gold into actual Bitcoin. Which investment strategy would have performed better?",
      "content": "\"Bitcoin is digital gold\" is something we've all heard as long as we've been snooping around in the rabbit hole. I recall when I first was first trying to wrap my brain around bitcoin, asked about it, and someone came back with their simplest answer: \"digital gold\". I remember thinking that was a snippy, snarky answer. Then, I started thinking, \"You know, they're kinda right.\" It puts the focus of scarcity into a digital realm, which was entirely new in 2008 and '09. Just as you can't alchemy-up gold, you can't copy/paste bitcoin.\n\nRecently, however, I'm thinking the digital gold concept is good but not entirely right. I think it might be backwards. Instead of bitcoin being digital gold, I think gold might be \"golden digital\". \n\n\"Digital gold\" implies that gold is the standard. It implies that gold is what we ultimately want to hold and that bitcoin is merely a way to hold gold's value in an alternative, digital manner. \n\nBy contrast, reverse this thinking. The term \"golden digital\" implies that the digital, the bitcoin, is the standard. It implies that bitcoin is what we ultimately want to hold and that gold is merely a way to hold bitcoin's value in an alternative, physical manner. \n\nTo these ends, let's do a comparison.\n\nImagine a physical bitcoin made of gold. A typical silver dollar coin or one of the classic Casascius bitcoin physical coins both have dimensions of around 31mm diameter by 3mm thickness. The estimated weight, if made of gold, is 71 grams. So, 71 grams of gold can be easily assigned a USD value given the current USD-gold exchange rate.\n\nBut, what if that 71 grams of gold value was used to purchase BTC? At any given moment, the swapping-around rate would all be the same: gold value, BTC value, USD value. But, over time, which investment wins? In other words, would you be better off holding the 71 grams of physical gold as a tangible coin or holding that amount of BTC as \"golden digital\"?\n\nI vibe-coded this tool to find out:\nhttps://goldendigital.vercel.app\n\nPick a start date, compare gold versus bitcoin. There are some tweaks to flesh out, such as the date range only works back to about 2020 or so. But, it seems to be functioning alright and seems interesting enough. It's on. \n\n\n![goldendigital.png](https://files.peakd.com/file/peakd-hive/crrdlx/23t8CSPF9HVwNxnw5rDerg3LQfrjRmCafjxe25nJvwXseha4kXMJ3rxP47UBnX8pHmQXo.png)",

      "summary": "We’ve been told to fear the very foods that built us.\nThis article explores how fasting, raw carnivore nutrition, heat, and movement re-activate the body’s natural anti-aging systems — the real fountain of youth within every cell.",
      "content": "## How I Combine Biology, Fasting and Nutrition to Slow Down Aging\n\n> \\[!quote] “The fountain of youth is not something you find — it’s something you activate.\\\n> It already exists in every cell, waiting for the chance to repair itself.”\n\n## 🧠 Introduction\n\nMost people look for health in pills, diets, or quick fixes.\\\nI did too — until I began to understand how the body actually works.\\\nWhen I stopped trying to *force* the body to feel good and instead started to cooperate with its natural rhythm, everything changed.\n\nMy energy, focus, and sleep improved. Even my heart rate and body temperature told me that something fundamental had shifted.\n\nWhat I’ve discovered isn’t magic.\\\nIt’s **biology**.\n\n***\n\n## ⚙️ 1. The Body’s Built-In Anti-Aging System\n\nThe human body already has everything it needs to repair and rejuvenate itself. We where never meant to have metabolic disease like diabetes, cancer and heart disease. It does this through three main processes:\n\n* 🧹 **Autophagy** – the body’s cellular cleanup system, recycling damaged proteins and components.\n\n* 🔋 **Mitochondrial biogenesis** – creation of new mitochondria, our energy factories.\n\n* 🧬 **Hormonal restoration** – natural surges of growth hormone, testosterone, and repair signals during fasting and deep sleep.\n\nModern habits — constant eating, sugar, stress, and inactivity — keep these systems **switched off** almost all the time.\\\nI realized that if I simply let the body alternate between *cleansing* and *building*, it could take care of itself.\n\n***\n\n## ⏳ 2. My Daily Rhythm\n\nI eat **one meal per day (OMAD)**, usually around **3:30 PM**.\\\nThat gives me roughly 20–21 hours of fasting every day followed by a focused rebuilding phase.\n\n**Morning:**\n\n* A cup of bone broth with a little fat and minerals — enough to warm and hydrate, but not enough to break autophagy.\n\n* Fasted training around 7:30 AM followed by sauna (16 minutes). 3 days resistance training, heavy weights. Tuesday and Thursday some calisthenics skill work, more rest. Saturdays I train sprints or Norwegian Protocol to increase VO2Max (one of the most important ways to measure health).\n\n  * Training + heat → increases **growth hormone** and **heat-shock proteins (HSP70)** that help repair cells.\n\n**Afternoon (3:30 PM):**\n\n* My OMAD meal: **raw, grass-fed meat, fat, and egg yolks**.\n\n  * Extremely nutrient-dense, minimal AGEs, activates mTOR for rebuilding.\n\n  * All the nutrients we need are in raw meat. No nutrients we need to eat are in vegetables.\n\n**Evening:**\n\n* Glycine + apigenin + magnesium → deeper sleep and enhanced GH release.\n\n**Sunday:**\n\n* Dry fast → deep autophagy, immune reset, and cellular renewal.\n\n***\n\n## 🧬 3. Humanity’s Natural Diet and History\n\n> \\[!quote] “Humans haven’t changed — only our environment has.\\\n> Our cells, genes, and brains are still adapted to the diet and rhythm that shaped us.”\n\nFor over two million years, humans were **apex predators** on Ice Age plains.\\\nStable-isotope analysis of Neanderthal and early Homo sapiens bones shows that our ancestors ranked **above lions and wolves** in the food chain.\\\nTheir protein and fat came from large, fatty megafauna — mammoth, bison, and aurochs.\n\nDuring the glacial periods, only the fattest animals survived.\\\nThis meant access to abundant **animal fats rich in long-chain fatty acids with 20 and 22-carbon atoms (DHA, AA)** — the very molecules that make up **about 90 % of the mammalian brain**. Plants, by contrast, produce mainly 18-carbon fats that cannot sustain brain-tissue synthesis.\\\nThat’s why the human brain expanded so rapidly: it was literally *fueled by animal fat*.\n\n> \\[!note] Archaeological evidence shows that human brain size shrank by roughly 11 % when agriculture and plant-based diets took over about 12 000 years ago.\n\nAcross cultures we see the same pattern:\n\n* **Weston A. Price** documented healthy, cavity-free, strong peoples living on animal fat, organs, and fermented foods.\n\n* **Inuit, Maasai, Aboriginals, Mongols, and Native Americans** thrived on animal foods — often raw or fermented.\n\n* **Genghis Khan’s army** crossed continents on dried meat, blood, and milk — and built the largest empire on Earth.\n\n* **The Spartans** trained fasted and ate infrequently — meat, blood, and fat.\n\nIt’s no coincidence that these groups had **strength, endurance, and robust health** far beyond what agrarian societies showed.\\\nThey ate the diet our biology still expects: **fat-rich, animal-based, often raw**, with long natural fasts between meals.\n\n> \\[!tip] What I practice today — raw carnivore, OMAD, and fasting — isn’t “biohacking.”\\\n> It’s simply a return to the **human default setting** that built our brains and sustained us for hundreds of thousands of generations.\n\n## 🥩 4. Why the Raw Carnivore Diet Works\n\nRaw, grass-fed animal foods are not only dense in nutrition — they also lack the **advanced glycation end products (AGEs)** that form through cooking and sugar exposure.\n\nWhen AGEs decrease:\n\n* Blood vessels regain elasticity.\n\n* Skin maintains structure and tone.\n\n* Mitochondria experience less oxidative stress.\n\nMeat, fat, and eggs provide the amino acids and micronutrients needed to rebuild after fasting.\\\nIt’s evolution’s logic: **hunt first, eat later, rest after.**\n\n***\n\n## 💊 5. My Supplements — Support, Not Replacement\n\n> \\[!tip] I use supplements as *tools*, not crutches.\\\n> They amplify natural signals but never replace them.\n\n| Supplement                       | Function                                                              |\n| -------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------- |\n| **PQQ + Ubiquinol**              | Stimulate new mitochondria and protect existing ones                  |\n| **L-Carnosine + Glycine**        | Reduce glycation and oxidative damage                                 |\n| **Magnesium + Boron + D3/K2**    | Hormonal balance, nervous system, and sleep support                   |\n| **Astaxanthin + MSM + Collagen** | Antioxidant and structural protection for skin, joints, and membranes |\n\n***\n\n## 🔬 6. Why It Works\n\n| Phase                     | Active Process                | Effect                       |\n| ------------------------- | ----------------------------- | ---------------------------- |\n| **Morning**               | AMPK ↑, Sirtuins ↑, Mitophagy | Cellular cleanup and renewal |\n| **Post-training / Sauna** | PGC-1α activation, GH ↑       | Mitochondrial biogenesis     |\n| **Afternoon (OMAD)**      | mTOR ↑, IGF-1 ↑               | Protein synthesis and repair |\n| **Night / Sleep**         | GH + Melatonin                | DNA repair, deep restoration |\n\n💡 The daily alternation between fasting, training, heat, and nourishment lets the body cycle between **“cleaning”** and **“building”** — exactly as it evolved to do.\n\n***\n\n## 💰 7. Why Most People Don’t Live This Way\n\n> \\[!warning] We’ve been taught to fear what once made us human.\n\nDuring the 20th century, our perception of food changed — not through evolution, but through **industry and propaganda**.\\\nPhysiologist **Ancel Keys** popularized the *lipid hypothesis*, wrongly blaming cholesterol and animal fat for heart disease.\\\nThe food and pharmaceutical industries seized on this idea, building billion-dollar markets around cheap vegetable oils, grains, and sugar — labeling them “healthy.”\n\nMeanwhile, animal fat, salt, and raw meat were demonized.\\\nMovies filled our culture with fear: **vampires, zombies, and cannibals** made raw flesh seem disgusting or dangerous.\\\nIt’s almost absurd how effective that conditioning has been — while **the Japanese** eat raw fish daily, with low inflammation, long lifespans, and high cognitive performance.\n\nThe result is a worldwide nutritional inversion: humanity replaced **natural fats with refined carbohydrates**, then tried to medicate the consequences instead of correcting the cause.\n\n> \\[!tip] This way of living isn’t new, extreme, or risky — it’s simply the reversal of 70 years of misguided fear-based nutrition.\\\n> Returning to real food, natural rhythm, and raw nourishment isn’t rebellion — it’s restoration.\n\n## 🌞 8. Results\n\nSince adopting this lifestyle I’ve noticed:\n\n* Steady focus all day without blood-sugar swings\n\n* Deep, stable sleep\n\n* No inflammation or aches\n\n* A calm, centered mind and steady body temperature\n\nMy body feels like it’s working *with* me, not against me.\\\nI sometimes call it “living in autophagy” — but in truth, it’s simply living as humans were designed to.\n\n> \\[!success] **Conclusion**\\\n> The fountain of youth is within us.\\\n> It already exists in every cell, waiting for the chance to repair itself.\n",

      "title": "The Beast's Yield: Opponent Processing in an Ancient Tale",
      "summary": "# The Beast's Yield: Opponent Processing in an Ancient Tale",
      "content": "# The Beast's Yield: Opponent Processing in an Ancient Tale\n\n*This post continues exploring opponent processing and tensegrity from&#x20;*[*the previous post*](https://djinoz.substack.com/p/tensegrity-and-opponent-processing)*. If you've arrived midway through this&#xA0;*[*tensegrity*](https://djinoz.substack.com/p/tensegrity-a-backgrounder-16a)*&#x20;series, the core idea: opposing forces—compression and tension—can create structure rather than just conflict. From this, something magical (or dare I say \"sacred\") happens.*\n\nOnce upon a time in a far off land before cinema multiplexes and Disney channel lived a humble folktale. A father picks a rose from an enchanted garden. The Beast who owns it demands one of his daughters come live with him as punishment. The youngest (Beauty) acquiesces to honour and protect her father, then finds herself treated with unexpected generosity alongside the Beast's fearsome nature. She gradually comes to care for him, and when she confesses love, the Beast dies to his old form and a prince emerges. [Multiple versions here](https://sites.pitt.edu/~dash/type0425c.html#jacobs).\n\n**Context first**: Yes, Beauty and the Beast has been [interpreted as hoodwinking](https://sites.pitt.edu/~dash/type0425c.html#jacobs) young girls into marrying older, monied men (Whose visage has devolved along with the battles of worldly commerce into something beastly). Yes, it may derive from the Roman myth of Psyche and Cupid.[\\[1\\]](#fn1) These readings do matter, but, the narrative mechanics encode how an adversarial (opponent) setting creates structure for an outcome that is better for all (transcending game mechanics[\\[2\\]](#fn2).\n\n## The Setup\n\nThe Beast demonstrates violence and malevolence. He *demands*— the ownership of Beauty as retribution, he \"compresses\" her purity with rigid dominance in the cage of his house. The maiden (youngest of three, the purity figure) accepts her imprisonment with vulnerability. But not submission.\n\n## The Critical Phase\n\nBeauty and Beast exist in apparent opposition - two dissimilar forces held in a tension.\n\nOver time, the Beast shows generosity—not replacing his beastly overbearing nature but *alongside* it.\n\nCrucially, they meet daily, talk daily. This isn't passive coexistence; it's sustained engagement. She finds something to love, possibly unconsciously sensing the \"prince trapped within.\" This is key: she doesn't love *despite* the beast. She loves *through* him, maintaining tension while perceiving what's compressed inside.\n\nNOTE: Beauty's yielding is not complete submission (collapse), nor is the Beast overbearing, domineering (compression) or exploitative; there is an honourable **tensegrity** between the protagonists.\n\n## The Structural Shift\n\nThe Beast \"lies down\"—explicitly stops forcing the structure. Until now, the spell (surface appearance) was maintained by his rigid enmity but no longer, he too shows vulnerability. Her confession of love acknowledges that their tension created something real. His death-to-old-nature releases the over-bearing grip (compression). The prince emerges not as a third thing but as what was always there when forces properly balanced.\n\n![Hegelian Dialect process](https://blossom.primal.net/d375f403580871f62c4127ed4bcfb858274e9649116d2cbf7111f6d1a4e6189b.png \"Hegelian Dialect process\")\n\nThis follows the Hegelian dialectic: the Beast (thesis) and Beauty's resistance (antithesis) don't just compromise or cancel out. Through sustained engagement, they produce a synthesis—the prince and transformed relationship. Neither the original Beast nor the maiden-under-duress remains. Something genuinely new emerges from the opposition.\n\nThe magic is that the two created conditions for the prince via their good will, persistence, fortitude and a an attention to what lie beneath surface appearances.\n\n***\n\nThis is a **sacred act** conjured by both.\n\n***\n\n## Why This Pattern Persists\n\nStories that encode opponent-process dynamics—where opposing forces create rather than destroy structure—survive across millennia because they map onto lived experience. The same pattern appears (from my earlier prefacing posts) in Taiji's lu (rollback), in tensegrity structures, in how yielding can be strength.\n\nTensegrity is the perfect balance point of opposing forces. In push hands, the capacity for deep and sensitive *ting* (listening) is the highest calling—not because it's passive, but because it creates the conditions for synthesis. You can only find the balance point if you're genuinely feeling the other force. You can only yield effectively if you're truly listening to where the compression pushes. You can only listen if you calm your nervous system and mind.\n\nImagine how frightened a young Beauty would be trapped in a Beast's house. She is operating at some high level of meditative stillness to not freak out completely.\n\n## The Constraint That Creates\n\nNotice what happens during the critical phase: Beauty and the Beast spend constrained but deliberate time together. Their relationship after lunch is an \"arena\" for dialogue and company—dynamic opponent processing in real time.\n\nShe[\\[3\\]](#fn3) doesn't run, hide, dismiss, ghost or strawman him (\"he's just a filthy beast\"). He doesn't force compliance. They engage in good faith without collapsing their own true natures.\n\n## What's the point of all this waffle?\n\nThis post may be too far \"into the weeds\" for the average 2025 attention span, but I do think we have an opportunity to directly experience a **sacred** process in a very normal (and therefore **taken-for-granted**) everyday way. Work on ourselves and work with others. For example....\n\n### Self-Work and Transformation\n\nOk, don't roll your eyes, I know Jung is some old codger psychologist to most people, but if you ever get a chance take a look at his \"The [Red](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NM0GkVi0TSg) [Book\"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Red_Book_%28Jung%29), to my eyes is a monumental work of **self** Opponent Processing. The book documents his intense personal and spiritual journey of confronting the unconscious and clearly qualifies him as a fully qualified mystic.\n\nThrough a Jungian lens, this folktale maps onto internal integration as much as external relationships:\n\n* The Beast represents masculine consciousness encountering its own anima—the feminine principle compressed within.\n\n* Beauty's willingness to see the prince \"encapsulated within\" mirrors the work every psyche must do: recognising and befriending the parts of ourselves that don't match our surface.\n\nSpecifically as an internal work:\n\n* The daily dialogue isn't just between two people but between conscious ego and inner opposite.\n\n* When the Beast \"lies down,\" it's the masculine principle yielding to its own feminine aspect, allowing what was always internal to emerge.\n\n* The synthesis isn't man-meets-woman but psyche-meets-itself, the animus/anima integration that Jung saw as essential to wholeness.\n\n* The spell that locks the prince in beast-form is the rigidity that refuses this recognition—the masculine consciousness that can't acknowledge its own receptive, feeling dimension until met with persistent, unflinching feminine presence.\n\nTransformation requires both the strength that demands and the willingness to yield. The beast who never lies down remains monstrous. The maiden who collapses finds no prince. The tension between them is what makes emergence possible.\n\n![Chapter IX Elijah and Salome an aspect of Jung's anima](https://npub1xpj4tlhygv6c9ve0d4r0zxmyfk3n39je2qtgj0ta5xx8tltlmufqpvcped.blossom.band/bb90ae1927f4ab740e18655f8d78ca86178e52c28807591bd8135d6615c718c5.jpg)\n\n### Your meditation practice\n\nFor many of us, meditation might be 15 minutes of thinking and thinking denial and scolding ourselves for thinking. Those are the brave ones. Most people say some variation of \"it doesn't work for them\", \"don't have enough time\" or more honestly \"its a waste of time\".\n\nSo you can see that the voice in your head is an admirable opponent for some opponent-processing. We know this voice can make ANYTHING up, it can make me care deeply and emotionally and neurotically about that thought, then 5 minutes later commence torture with another thought.\n\nThank goodness for distractions of children and family and career, that will keep the voice on less difficult monologs! \n\nSo to sit in meditation and resolve to be with the voice and set it aside, let it go is a worthy opponent processing opportunity. There is a tensegrity balance where lots of energy is created and that is when the meditation practice gets very interesting.\n\n### Modern Discourse\n\nThis is the mechanism modern discourse lacks. The dialectic requires *presence*—actual time spent with the opposition, not caricatures of it. The ad hominem is lazy. The bad-faith debate is a refusal to sit at the table. The transformative third only emerges when both parties maintain tension *while actually engaging* - sustained, uncomfortable proximity of genuine opponent processing.\n\nWe can start with this kind of opponent processing with our partner/spouse, our close colleagues. Pretty much any person you don't agree with.\n\n**Caveat:** Maybe don't start with social media, the chance of getting good faith engagement on X would be low. It takes a very high level adept or a sociapath to opponent process here - and only one of those is seeking tensegrity.\n\n***\n\nWe want shortcuts. We want to skip the dinners. But the structure only emerges from the tension, and the tension only works when both sides show up.\n\n### Exemplars for our children\n\nOur screen culture overrides good parenting to teach children to be: self-centered, triggered, overly dramatic, combative - where are the exemplars of these finer human qualities? Perhaps I should watch Disney channel more?\n\nI fear that \"mindfullness\" taught in schools and apps largely has a victim mindset applied to calm down \"out of the arena\"\\[\\[4\\]](#fn4). We all need training that allows us good faith when engaging with others that we may not agree with (or even the voices in our own head!).\n\n \n\n***\n\n*This is part of a series exploring tensegrity, opponent processing, and how structures emerge from opposition. See the links at the top to others in the series.*\n\n***\n\n1.

      "title": "My Response to Joe Bradford.",
      "summary": "In this article, I share my response to Joe Bradford on X (Formerly known as Twitter). This article covers topics like bitcoin, deflation, economic theory and more. ",
      "content": "What seems to be increasingly apparent is the prevalance of assertions of what \"Islamic Economics\" is, when in reality such phrases are disguised by Keynesian fallacies and blunders. This was a thread I made in response to Joe Bradford and was asked to post the thread here as well. \n\n\"Ustadh Joe Bradford gives an interesting summary that I believe gives us interesting insights but I do have several disagreements/issues that I wish he responds to.\n\n#1. Bradford seems to imply that the monetary base, fiat in this context, is non-problematic if it is exploitive risk-transfer free and riba free. This articulation seems problematic because the very mechanism that enables fiat to exist is those two components. Fiat by definition is money decreed by the state that is not backed by a real asset. The supply of such must occur through credit as it is the case that people would not hold this money otherwise. Even if we assume that fiat money creation could occur without interest based loans There is injustice occurring since the issuer gains seigniorage with no productive effort involved and holders of that money lose as the purchasing power of that money declines. It seems very weird then that this is articulated as a supposed neutral money. It is not neutral money.\n\nThe difference between bitcoin and fiat is that fiat is inherently a money that requires credit and riba for its supply when bitcoin does not. Anything that occurs on the monetary base layer could be indeed forbidden or permissible though, this is true, even for bitcoin.\n\nThere is another issue that I seem to find issue with, and it is the distinction between the functionality of money and its supply. While this may be a true distinction in theory, it does not hold for fiat because the supply plays into its functionality.\n\n\n#2 Bradford mentions how deflation could be even more regressive, this falls short. In a deflationary economy, demand for consumption goods decrease and capital begins to channel to higher order/capital goods. This is because people have a lower time preference.\n\nI will articulate such in the following visual graphs.  This is a trapezoid model derived from Hayek's articulation of production stages.\n ![image](https://image.nostr.build/d5f9dc8d4af9a99bf5652f36e215b4d435272159a0dbadb77288c3a481f53bb5.jpg)\n\nIn stage 1: Consumption decreases -> demand decreases -> prices begin to fall ![image](https://image.nostr.build/839413c87bfca4c21a33cb58f8b6a6f27442d5e509d268f790ef94e56e7faade.jpg)\n\n\nStage 2: People begin to invest, engage in equity investments, etc.. The originary interest rate decreases (Not the same as the interest rate on loans, or riba, it is an expression of time preference) The demand for higher order goods increase->The prices of higher order goods increase \n![image](https://image.nostr.build/0c8875837cac41fd65b9ed84e2454876f75fe36982d767110fc5a5a1e1e080d8.jpg)\n\nThis is sustainable because of increased wages, more employment, and the public spends income at lower levels  This will lead to an increase in the supply of capital goods which will lead to an increase in the supply of consumption goods, which leads to further deflation.\n\nEffectively, production increases. Bradford though seems to suggest that capital holders begin to hoard their money, but this does not seem supported deductively nor historically as this form of hoarding is irrational. Players are more profitable if they engage in investments.\n\nAs for this statement, \"evidenced by historical gold standard crises.\" Joe would need to inform us which exact crises he is discussing because studies point to a different implication. If he is referring to the great depression, that was the result of the suspension of the dollars to gold in 1914 which caused misallocations and an eventual bust. It was not the result of organic deflation that occurs from market occurrences, but rather misallocated capital followed by sudden deflation as a result of fiat.\n\n#3 He also asserts, \"When a mudarib generates returns through productive activity, economic value grows beyond the fixed Bitcoin supply\". This misunderstands what money is, because money and prices are adjustable to economic growth.\n\nThe supply does not need to grow to match economic growth, because prices adjust and match that. If the supposed value increases beyond the money supply, then each unit will just increase in price. Bitcoin is very divisible too so it allows for it to occur.\n\nSecondly, mudaraba and and musharaka make claims on future profits, not the base money itself. No new currency is issued, unlike fiat of course.\n\nLastly, Joe asserts \"By treating money creation as the disease rather than interest-based contracts as the problem\"\nIn fiat, money creation occurs via interest based contracts. They are inseparable, unless Joe wishes to create a new form of fiat that contradict what fiat is.\nEven then, the issues with that are still problematic as mentioned above.\n\nFinally, business cycles occur because of fiat, as artificial credit expansion causes misallocation of capital which causes the bust after a temporary boom.\n\nTo add onto all this and to conclude, a currency that is capable of debasement and manipulation, will eventually be debased and manipulated. This is what history teaches us, and this is what bitcoin fixes.",

      "title": "Bitcoin Too Expensive? ",
      "summary": "A Look at the Supply Facts",
      "content": "You've likely heard the comment, \"Bitcoin is just too expensive.\" While this might sound intuitive at first, as Bitcoin’s price is now way above the magic $ 100,000 mark, it might not be a helpful argument. Let's delve into the human biases that influence this perception and examine the reality behind this statement.\n\n## Buyer's Perspective\n\nFor many potential investors, the high dollar price of Bitcoin can be daunting. This is often due to the \"anchoring bias,\" where individuals fixate on the initial price they encounter: \"When I first saw Bitcoin's price, it seemed like an impossible investment.\" When you look back where Bitcoin came from, it can feel like standing at the edge of a cliff. How can it go higher than where we already are? Seems impossible. However, understanding Bitcoin's unique supply and demand properties can shift this perspective.\n\n![](https://blossom.primal.net/3bc0b43c768e76331393d1c0ebc8cb5fb64ce77afcce23c88ac137b032003601.png)## Hard Money Facts\n\nBitcoin's fixed supply of 21 million coins is a crucial aspect of its value proposition. This scarcity is a fundamental driver of its price, yet it often contributes to the misconception that Bitcoin is overvalued simply because it is expensive. “Bitcoin's scarcity is what makes it valuable, just like gold.” This is close, but not quite true.\n\n### Supply Constraints of Gold\n\nGold's scarcity is influenced by geological factors and mining efficiency. As technology advances, it becomes more profitable to mine gold from previously unviable sources, potentially increasing supply over time. Thus, the average inflation rate of gold can vary significantly depending on the time frame and market conditions. According to the data of the World Gold Council, gold’s inflation rate is at around 1-2% annually over the long term.\n\nHowever, the available supply dynamics of gold can fluctuate dramatically, as history has shown. A prime example of this phenomenon occurred during the colonial era when the Spaniards transported vast quantities of gold from the Americas to Europe. This sudden influx of gold led to a significant increase in its supply, causing the price of gold to plummet. The economic consequences were profound, resulting in massive inflation and effectively devaluing gold, which was previously considered a stable and valuable hard asset.\n\nAdvances in mining technology have significantly expanded the global capacity to extract gold, leading to an extension of its supply. Innovations such as improved drilling techniques, more efficient extraction methods, and the use of advanced geophysical surveys have allowed miners to access previously unreachable deposits.\n\n![](https://elements.visualcapitalist.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/200-Years-of-Global-Gold-Production.jpg)### Supply Constraints of Bitcoin\n\nBitcoin’s scarcity however is mathematically fixed and a has a simple and verifiable distribution plan: On average very 10 minutes, 3,125 BTC will be added to the supply, and every 210,000 blocks, which is roughly every 4 years, this block reward will be reduced by 50%. Currently, the inflation rate of Bitcoin is around 1.7%, but this rate will continue to decline until it reaches zero, at which point Bitcoin will become completely deflationary.\n\n![](https://i1.wp.com/startusingbitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/bitcoin-inflation-monetary-base.png)## Rising Demand\n\nThe increasing demand for Bitcoin reflects its growing acceptance as a legitimate asset class and its potential as a global reserve currency. As retail buyers, institutional investors and nation states decision makers appreciate it unique supply characteristics, demand continues to rise, naturally pushing the price higher. This dynamic is often misunderstood, leading to the biased perception that Bitcoin is in a bubble.\n\nUnlike gold, where rising demand spurs increased mining and supply, Bitcoin's supply remains fixed at 21 million coins, no matter how high or low the demand is. This inelasticity creates a scarcity-driven dynamic, as supply cannot adjust to demand, making Bitcoin a uniquely valuable asset.\n\n## Sources\n\n- World Gold Council. (2025, July 31).

      "title": "A More Private Way To Do Collaborative Custody",
      "summary": "Love to see progress like this. ",
      "content": "## Marty's Bent\n\n[![](https://www.tftc.io/content/images/2025/10/Screenshot-2025-10-24-at-9.04.26---AM.png)](https://bitkey.build/chain-code-delegation-improving-privacy-in-collaborative-multisig/)\n\nvia [Bitkey](https://bitkey.build/chain-code-delegation-improving-privacy-in-collaborative-multisig/)\n\nYesterday Bitkey submitted a Bitcoin Improvement Proposal (BIP) for \"Chain Code Delegation\", which would significantly improve the privacy of bitcoin users who utilize collaborative multisig set ups. For those who are unaware of collaborative multisig setups, the concept is that, as a user, you can increase the robustness and resiliency of your multisig wallet by adding a collaborative custody partner to the multisig quorum. This is the model that companies like Bitkey, Unchained offer their clients.\n\nIt's a great tradeoff because it provides individuals who find the responsibility of holding their bitcoin in a single signature address and securing the wallet and back up properly too daunting. With collaborative multisig you are able to maintain unilateral control over your bitcoin with a fall back option to have your custody partner help you if you're in a pinch because you only have access to one wallet or you lost a wallet and its back up. But, to date, it's been a tradeoff that comes with a privacy leak. Your collaborative custody partner knows exactly how much bitcoin you have in the public address associated with the multisig quorum at all times. This is because of the way multisig wallets are typically created on the application layer. All parties participating in a multisig quorum currently need to share a lot of information about the wallet, particularly the xpub.\n\nWith Chain Code Delegation, this will no longer be the case. Users can reap the benefits of collaborative custody without having to disclose their public addresses and balances. The only time they would reveal a balance to their collaborative custody partner is if that cosigner is needed to sign a transaction. And even then, they would only know about the individual UTXOs included in the transaction.\n\nThis is a massive boon to privacy and it is incredible to see the Bitkey team leading the charge. Shout out to everyone on the Bitkey team who worked on this and Jesse Posner (formerly with Bitkey). It will be cool to see this in the wild.\n\nThis is particularly exciting because, as I mentioned earlier, this type of \"upgrade\" is isolated to the application layer. There is no need to make a consensus or policy change to bitcoin. It's simply a new standard for creating multisig wallets.\n\n***\n\n### The Basis Trade Represents a Significant Systemic Risk\n\nRobert from Infranomics broke down a ticking time bomb in the Treasury market that regulators have been watching for years. The basis trade, where hedge funds short Treasury futures while going long on cash Treasuries, might seem innocuous at first glance. After all, it's just capturing a tiny 0.1% arbitrage spread. But here's where it gets dangerous: funds are leveraging this trade anywhere from 50:1 to as high as 100:1, turning a small edge into meaningful profits while creating massive systemic risk.\n\n\"This is well documented. If you Google, this has been an issue for years. This has been a risk that the Fed has known about.\"- [Robert (Infraa)](https://x.com/infraa_)\n\nRobert pointed to the 2020 blowup and the April \"Liberation Day\" incident as proof this trade can unravel violently. The Brookings Institute even published warnings in June. When SOFR spiked to 0.19% last week, the highest since 2020, it signaled fresh stress in the repo market financing all this leverage. The Fed, SEC, and CFTC know the risks. The question is what happens when it blows up again.\n\nCheck out the [full podcast here](https://youtu.be/j_VA2wcyRxE) for more on the Cayman Islands Treasury revelation, populism's impact on assets, and why Bitcoin matters now.\n\n***\n\n### Headlines of the Day\n\n[Crypto Firms Donate to Trump Ballroom](https://x.com/WatcherGuru/status/1981503515651690530)\n\n[Bitcoin Poised to Surge per Gold Lag Trend](https://x.com/BitcoinNewsCom/status/1981481711033565499)\n\n[Strive Exec Details Bitcoin Treasury Firms](https://x.com/TFTC21/status/1981478218554355871)\n\n[Binance Takes $2B Trump-Linked Stablecoin](https://x.com/TFTC21/status/1981466076438548939)\\\n\\\n[Trump Says CZ Pardon Not for a Crime](https://x.com/BitcoinNewsCom/status/1981463899292783004)\n\n***\n\n[![](https://www.tftc.io/content/images/2025/10/D1-1.png)](http://unchnd.co/46Mnnpx)\n\n[Register Now](http://unchnd.co/46Mnnpx)\n\nIs the fiat retirement system sinking?
